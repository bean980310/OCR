      "Motion prediction is a central yet challenging problem for autonomous vehicles to safely navigate under uncertainties. Motion prediction, in the autonomous driving setting, refers to the prediction of the future trajectories of modeled agents, conditioned on the histories of the modeled agents, context agents, road graph and traffic light signals. Several key challenges arise in the motion prediction problem. First, motion prediction is probabilistic and multimodal in nature where it is importan...\n",

      "Text: Recent works exploit adversarial attacks [57] to conceal user identity by overlaying noise-constrained (bounded) adversarial perturbations on the original face image [6,53,74]. Since the adversarial examples are generally optimized in the image space, it is often difficult to simultaneously achieve naturalness and privacy [70]. Unlike noise-based methods, unrestricted adversarial examples are not constrained by the magnitude of perturbation in the image space and have demonstrated better perceptual realism for human observers while being adversarially effective [3,55, 68,76]. Several efforts have been made to generate unrestricted adversarial examples that mislead FR systems (see Tab. 1) [22,25, 39,72]. Among these, adversarial makeup based methods [22,72] are gaining increasing attention as they can embed adversarial modifications in a more natural way. These approaches use generative adversarial networks [15] (GANs) to adversarially transfer makeup from a given reference image to the user’s face image while impersonating a target identity. However, existing techniques based on adversarial makeup transfer have the following limitations: (i) adversarial toxicity in these methods hamper the performance of the makeup transfer module, thereby resulting in unnatural faces with makeup artifacts (see Fig. 1); (ii) the use of a reference image to define the desired makeup style affects the practicality of this approach; (iii) for every new target identity, these approaches require end-to-end retraining from scratch using large makeup datasets; and (iv) most of these methods primarily aim at impersonation of the target identity, whereas the desired privacy objective is dodging, i.e., multiple images of the user’s face scraped from different social media sites must not match with each other. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a new approach to protect user facial privacy on online platforms (Sec. 3).

Our approach effectively hides attack information in the desired makeup style, without the need for any large makeup dataset or retraining of models for different target identities. ¢ Identity Preserving Regularization: We propose a regularizer that preserves identity-related attributes within the latent space of the generative model and ensures that the protected face image visually resembles the original face. Extensive experiments (Sec. 4.1) for both face verification and identification scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against black-box FR models and online commercial facial recognition APIs (Sec. 4.2).

      "Text: 3). The proposed approach aims to search for adversarial latent codes in a low-dimensional manifold learned by a generative model trained to generate face images [2,27]. Our main contributions are: * Facial Privacy-protection Framework Using Adversarial Latent Codes: Given a face image, we propose a novel two-step method to search for adversarial latent codes, which can be used by a generative model (e.g., StyleGAN) to produce face images with high visual quality that matches human-perceived identity, while deceiving black-box FR systems. ¢ Adversarial Makeup Transfer using Textual Prompts: A critical component of the above framework is a technique for leveraging user-defined textual (makeup) prompts to traverse over the latent manifold of the generative model and find transferable adversarial latent codes. Our approach effectively hides attack information in the desired makeup style, without the need for any large makeup dataset or retraining of models for different target identities. ¢ Identity Preserving Regularization: We propose a regularizer that preserves identity-related attributes within the latent space of the generative model and ensures that the protected face image visually resembles the original face. Extensive experiments (Sec. 4.1) for both face verification and identification scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against black-box FR models and online commercial facial recognition APIs (Sec. 4.2). Furthermore, we provide detailed ablative analysis to dissect the performance of different components of our approach (Sec. 4.3). --- --2. Related Work Obfuscation Methods: Obfuscation is the most widely used technique [38] to protect user’s facial privacy. Earlier obfuscation approaches typically degrade the quality of the original face image by applying simple operations such as masking [52, 64], filtering [33,78], and image transformations [8, 36, 62]. While these relatively simple obfuscation techniques are reasonable for surveillance applications, they are ill-suited for online/social media platforms where user experience is critical [41].\n",

      "Text: Though deep learning based obfuscation approaches generate more realistic images [4,7,56,58], they often result in a change of identity compared to the original image and occasionally produce undesirable artifacts [30, 31,34]. Noise-based Adversarial Examples: Adversarial attacks have been used to protect users from unauthorized FR models. Some methods [6,53] rely on data poisoning to deceive targeted FR models, but are less practical because access to the training data or the gallery set of the unknown FR system is often not available. Other approaches have used game-theory perspective [42] in white-box settings or person-specific privacy masks (one mask per person) to generate protected images at the cost of acquiring multiple images of the same user [77]. In contrast, we aim to fool the black box FR model using only single image. In TIPIM [70], targeted optimization was used to generate privacy masks against unknown FR models by introducing a naturalness constraint. While this approach provides effective privacy, it generates output images with perceptible noises that can affect the user experience [70]. Unrestricted Adversarial Examples: Unrestricted adversarial attacks (UAAs) are not constrained by the perturbation norm and can induce large but semantically meaningful perturbations. These attacks have been extensively studied in image classification literature [3, 35,55, 68,73, 76] and it has been shown that outputs generated via UAAs are less perceptible to human observers as compared to noise-based adversarial attacks. Motivated by this observation, patchbased unrestricted attacks have been proposed to generate wearable adversarial accessories like colorful glasses [54], hat [29] or random patch [69] to fool the FR model, but such synthesized patches generally have weak transferability due to the limited editing region and the large visible pattern compromises naturalness and affects user experience. Recently, generative models [24,50] have been leveraged to craft UAAs against FR models. However, these generative approaches are either designed for the whitebox settings [46,79] or show limited performance in queryfree black-box settings [25].\n",

      "Text: Makeup-based UAAs [17,72] have also been proposed against FR systems by embedding the perturbations into a natural makeup effect. These makeup based attacks have also been exploited to protect the user privacy by applying adversarial makeup on the user face image [22]. However, interference between adversarial perturbations and makeup transfer can produce undesirable makeup artifacts in the output images. Moreover, these attacks generally assume access to large makeup datasets for training models and require a reference makeup image. In contrast, our approach finds adversarial faces on the natural image manifold in black-box setting via guidance from makeup text prompt, which makes it less susceptible to artifacts (see Fig. 1) and more practical. Vision-Language Modelling: Cross-modal _ visionlanguage modelling has attracted significant attention in recent years [13]. OpenAI introduced CLIP [47] that is trained on 400 million image-text pairs using contrastive objective and maps both image and text in a joint multimodal embedding space. With powerful representation embedding of CLIP, several methods have been proposed to manipulate images with text-guidance. StyleCLIP [44] and DiffusionCLIP [28,40] leverage the powerful generative capabilities of StyleGAN and diffusion models to manipulate images with text prompts. Other similar works include HairCLIP [66], CLIP-NeRF [60], CLIPstyler [32], and CLIPDraw [14]. While these methods focus on the text-guidance ability of CLIP, our approach aims to find the adversarial latent codes in a generative model’s latent space or privacy protection against black-box FR models. 3. Proposed Approach for Facial Privacy Our goal is to protect user facial privacy on online platorms against unknown (black-box) FR models without compromising on the user’s online experience. The proposed approach finds protected faces by adversarially exploring the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained generative model that is trained on natural face images.

A significant challenge during inversion is preserving the identity of the original image i.e., O(#) = O(ainy). Generally, optimization and encoder-based inversion approaches struggle to preserve identity after reconstruction [49] (see Fig. 3b). Moreover, when using these approaches, the inversion error can be large for out-of-domain face images with extreme poses and viewpoints, which are quite common in social media applications.

Therefore, we perturb only those latent codes associated with deeper layers of StyleGAN, thereby restricting the adversarial faces to the identity preserving manifold.

      "Text: For adversarial text guidance, we use a vision transformer-based CLIP model. For generator fine-tuning in the latent code initialization step, we use 450 iterations with value of A2 in Eq. 2 set to 0.5. For the makeup text input, we collect 40 text prompts based on the makeup style of diverse nature (details in supplementary material). For adversarial optimization, we use an Adam optimizer with B, and £5 set to 0.9 and 0.999, respectively, and a learning rate of 0.01. We run the optimizer for 50 iterations to craft protected faces. We set the value of Asay, Aciip, aNd Alatent to 1, 0.5, and 0.01, respectively. All our experiments are conducted on a A100 GPU with 40 GB memory. Datasets: We perform experiments for both face verification and identification settings. Face verification: We use CelebA-HQ [26] and LADN [16] for the impersonation attack. We select subset of 1,000 images from CelebA-HQ and report average results over 4 target identities provided by [22]. Similarly, for LADN, we divide the 332 images available into 4 groups, where images in each group aim to impersonate the target identities provided by [22]. For dodging attack, we use CelebA-HQ [26] and LFW [23] datasets. Specifically, we select 500 subjects at random and each subject has a pair of faces. Face identification: For impersonation and dodging, we use CelebA-HQ [26] and LFW [23] as our evaluation set. For both datasets, we randomly select 500 subjects, each with a pair of faces. We assign one image in the pair to the gallery set and the other to the probe set. Both impersonation and dodging attacks are performed on the probe set. For impersonation, we insert 4 target identities provided by [22] into the gallery set. A more detailed description of all datasets and pre-processing steps is provided in the supplementary material. Target Models: We aim to protect user facial privacy by attacking four FR model with diverse back bones in the black-box settings.\n",

Following standard protocol, we align and crop the face images using MTCNN [75] before giving them as input to FR models. Further, we also report privacy protection performance based on commercial FR API including Face++ and Tencent Yunshentu FR platforms. Evaluation metrics: Following [70], we use protection success rate (PSR) to evaluate the proposed approach. PSR is defined as the fraction of protected faces missclassified by the malicious FR system. To evaluate PSR, we use the thresholding and closed set strategies for face verification and identification, respectively. For face identification, we also use Rank-N targeted identity success rate (Rank-NT) and untargeted identity success rate (Rank-N-U), where Rank-N-T means that target image a’ will appear at least once in the top N candidates shortlisted from the gallery and Rank-N-U implies that the top N candidate list does not have the same identity as that of original image x. We also report results of PSNR (dB), SSIM, and FID [19] scores to evaluate the imperceptibility of method. Large PSNR and SSIM [65] indicates better match with the original images, while low FID score indicates more realistic images. For commercial APIs, we directly report the confidence score returned by the respective servers. Baseline methods: We compare our approach with recent noise-based and makeup based facial privacy protection approaches. Noise based methods include PGD [37], MI-FGSM [10], TI-DIM [11], and TIP-IM [70], whereas makeup-based approaches are Adv-Makeup [71] and AMTGAN [22]. We want to highlight that TIP-IM and AMTGAN are considered the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for face privacy protection against black-box FR systems in noisebased and unrestricted settings, respectively. TIP-IM also incorporate multi-target objective in its optimization to find the optimal target image among multiple targets. For fair comparison, we use its single target variant. 4.1.\n",

We have shown that incorporating a makeup text-guided loss and an identity preserving regularization effectively hides the adversarial perturbations in the makeup style, provides images with high quality, and preserves human-perceived identity. While this approach is robust to the user-defined text-prompt and target identity, it would be beneficial if the text-prompt and target identity can be automatically selected based on the given face image.

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutationinvariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions.

      "Text: Motion prediction is a central yet challenging problem for autonomous vehicles to safely navigate under uncertainties. Motion prediction, in the autonomous driving setting, refers to the prediction of the future trajectories of modeled agents, conditioned on the histories of the modeled agents, context agents, road graph and traffic light signals. Several key challenges arise in the motion prediction problem. First, motion prediction is probabilistic and multimodal in nature where it is important to faithfully predict an unbiased distribution of possible futures. Second, motion prediction requires jointly reasoning about the future distribution for a set of agents that may interact with each other in each such futures. Naively predicting and sampling from the marginal distribution of trajectories for each agent independently leads to unrealistic and often conflicting outcomes. Last but not least, while it is challenging to constrain or bias the predictions of conventional regression-based trajectory models, guided sampling of the trajectories is often required. For example, it may be useful to enforce rules or physical priors for creating tailored simulation scenarios. This requires the ability to enforce constraints over the future time steps, or enforce a specified behavior for one or --- --oT Trajectory scl + 82 <—— History Context Agents —~)| Encoder _—_ =T Traffic Light Road Graph ( WS S| Se 5?

      "Text: During inference, a population of trajectories for each agent can first be sampled from pure noise at the highest noise level omax, and iteratively denoised by the denoiser to produce a plausible distribution of future trajectories. An optional constraint in the form of an arbitrary differentiable loss function can be injected in the denoising process to enforce constraints. more agents among a set of agents. In light of these challenges, we present MotionDiffuser, a denoising diffusion model-based representation for the joint distribution of future trajectories for a set of agents (see Fig. 2). MotionDiffuser leverages a conditional denoising diffusion model. Denoising diffusion models 16, 23, 33, 43, 44] (henceforth, diffusion models) are a class of generative models that learns a denoising function based on noisy data and samples from a learned data distribution via iteratively refining a noisy sample starting from pure Gaussian noise (see Fig. 1). Diffusion models have recently gained immense popularity due to their simplicity, strong capacity to represent complex, high dimensional and multimodal distributions, ability to solve inverse problems 4, 6, 24, 44], and effectiveness across multiple problem domains, including image generation [36, 37, 39], video generation [15, 18, 49] and 3D shape generation [35]. Building on top of conditional diffusion models as a basis for trajectory generation, we propose several unique design improvements for the multi-agent motion prediction problem. First, we propose a cross-attention-based permutation-invariant denoiser architecture for learning the motion distribution for a set of agents regardless of their ordering. Second, we propose a general and flexible framework for performing controlled and guided trajectory sampling based on arbitrary differentiable cost functions of the trajectories, which enables several interesting applications such as rules and controls on the trajectories, trajectory in-painting and creating tailored simulation scenarios. Fi nally, we propose several enhancements to the representation, including PCA-based latent trajectory diffusion and improved trajectory sample clustering to further boost the performance of our model.

We are among the first to use diffusion models for predicting the joint motion of agents. --- --Constrained sampling Diffusion models have been shown to be effective at solving inverse problems such as image in-painting, colorization and sparse-view computed tomography by using a controllable sampling process [4— 6, 22, 24, 43, 44]. Concurrent work [53] explores diffusion modeling for controllable traffic generation, which we compare to in Sec. 3.4. In diffusion models, the generation process can be conditioned on information not available during training. The inverse problem can be posed as sampling from the posterior p(a; y) based on a learned unconditional distribution p(a), where y is an observation of the event «x. We defer further technical details to Sec. 3.4. Motion prediction There are two main categories of approaches for motion prediction: supervised learning and generative learning. Supervised learning trains a model with logged trajectories with supervised losses such as Lloss. One of the challenges is to model inherent multimodal behavior of the agents. For this, MultiPath [40] uses static anchors, and MultiPath++ [48], Wayformer [31], SceneTransformer [32] use learned anchors, and DenseTNT [13] uses goal-based predictions. Home [9] and GoHome [10] predict future occupancy heatmaps, and then decode trajectories from the samples. MP3 [2] and NMP [50] learn the cost function evaluator of trajectories, and then the output trajectories are heuristically enumerated. Many of these approaches use ensembles for further diversified predictions. The next section covers generative approaches.\n",

      "Text: Generative models for motion prediction Various recent works have modeled the motion prediction task as a conditional probability inference problem of the form p(s;e) using generative models, where s denote the future trajectories of one or more agents, and ec denote the context or observation. HP-GAN [1] learns a probability density function (PDF) of future human poses conditioned on previous poses using an improved Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (C-VAEs) [1 1, 20, 34], Normalizing Flows [8, 28, 29, 41] have also been shown to be effective at learning this conditional PDF of future trajectories for motion prediction. Very recent works have started looking into diffusion models as an alternative to modeling the conditional distributions of future sequences such as human motion pose sequences [38, 52] and planning [21]. In a more relevant work, [14] the authors utilize diffusion models to model the uncertainties of pedestrian motion. As far as we are aware, we are the first to utilize diffusion models to model the multi-agent joint motion distribution. Multi-agent motion prediction While much of the motion prediction literature has worked on predicting motions of individual agents independently, there has been some work to model the motion of multiple agents jointly. SceneTransformer [32] outputs a fixed set of joint motion predictions for all the agents in the scene. M2I [45], WIMP [25], PIP [42], and CBP [47] propose a conditional model where the motions of the other agents are predicted by given motions of the controlled agents. There is a set of literature using probabilistic graphical models. DSDNet [51] and MFP [46] use fully connected graphs. JFP [27] supports static graphs such as fully connected graphs and autonomous vehicle centered graphs, and dynamic graphs where the edges are constructed between the interacting agents. RAIN [26] learns the dynamic graph of the interaction through separate RL training. 3. Method 3.1.
