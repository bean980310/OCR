Abstract

We present the Recognize Anything Model (RAM): a
strong foundation model for image tagging. RAM makes
a substantial step for large models in computer vision,
demonstrating the zero-shot ability to recognize any com-
mon category with high accuracy. RAM introduces a new
paradigm for image tagging, leveraging large-scale image-
text pairs for training instead of manual annotations.

The development of RAM comprises four key steps.
Firstly, annotation-free image tags are obtained at scale
through automatic text semantic parsing. Subsequently, a
preliminary model is trained for automatic annotation by
unifying the caption and tagging tasks, supervised by the
original texts and parsed tags, respectively. Thirdly, a data
engine is employed to generate additional annotations and
clean incorrect ones. Lastly, the model is retrained with the
processed data and fine-tuned using a smaller but higher-
quality dataset.

We evaluate the tagging capabilities of RAM on numer-
ous benchmarks and observe impressive zero-shot perfor-
mance, significantly outperforming CLIP and BLIP. Re-
markably, RAM even surpasses the fully supervised man-
ners and exhibits competitive performance with the Google

tagging API. We are releasing the RAM at

//recognize-anything.github. io/ to foster the
advancements of large models in computer vision.

1. Introduction

Large language models (LLM) trained on large-scale
web datasets have sparked a revolution in nature language
processing (NLP). These models{20] [5] exhibit impressive
zero-shot generalization, enabling them to generalize to
tasks and data distributions beyond their training domain.
When it comes to computer vision (CV), Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has also demonstrated remarkable zero-
shot localization abilities through data scaling-up.

However, SAM lacks the capability to output semantic

labels, which is another foundational task on par with lo-
calization. Multi-label image recognition, also known as
image tagging, aims to provide semantic labels by recog-
nizing multiple labels of a given image. Image tagging
is a significant and practical computer vision task, as im-
ages inherently contain multiple labels encompassing ob-
jects, scenes, attributes, and actions. Regrettably, existing
models in multi-label classification, detection, segmenta-
tion, and vision-language approaches have exhibited defi-
ciency in tagging, characterized by limited scopes or poor
accuracy, as illustrated in Figure[]]

Two core components impede the progress of image tag-
ging. 1) The difficulty lies in collecting large-scale high-
quality data. Specifically, there is a lack of a universal and
unified label system and an efficient data annotation engine,
capable of semi-automatic or even automatic annotation of
large-scale images with a vast number of categories. 2)
There is a lack of efficient and flexible model design that can
leverage large-scale weakly-supervised data to construct an
open-vocabulary and powerful model.

To address these key bottlenecks, this paper introduces

Figure 2. The comparison of recognition capability among tagging models. RAM recognize more valuable tags than other models without
missing important part. ML-Decoder and Google tagging API tend to output redundant tags (e.g., “human head”) or less relevant tags
(e.g., “property”) tags. BLIP’s tag recall is limited as it relies on caption generation. Note: borderline tags are not listed here.

the Recognize Anything Model (RAM), a strong foundation
model for image tagging. RAM overcomes the challenges
related to data, including label system, dataset and data en-
gine, as well as the limitations in model design.

Label System: We begin by establishing a universal and
unified label system. We incorporate categories from popu-
lar academic datasets (classification, detection, and segmen-
tation) as well as commercial tagging products (Google,
Microsoft, Apple). Our label system is obtained by merg-
ing all the public tags with the common tags from texts, thus
covering most of common labels with a moderate amount of
6,449. The remaining open-vocabulary labels can be iden-
tified through open-set recognition.

Dataset: How to automatically annotate large-scale im-

ages with the label system is another challenge Draw-
ing inspiration from CLIP and ALIGN » which

leverage publicly available image-text pairs at scale to train
powerful visual models, we adopt similar datasets for im-
age tagging. To utilize these large-scale image-text data
for tagging, following [9] [10], we parse the texts and ob-
tain the image tags through automatic text semantic pars-
ing. This process allows us to obtain a diverse collection of

annotation-free image tags in accordance with image-text
pairs.

Data Engine: However, the image-text pairs from the
web are inherently noisy, often containing missing or incor-
rect labels. To enhance the quality of annotations, we de-
sign a tagging data engine. In addressing missing label, we
leverage existing models to generate additional tags. With
regards to incorrect labels, we first localize specific regions
corresponding to different tags within the image. Subse-
quently, we employ region clustering techniques to identify
and eliminate outliers within the same class. Furthermore,
we filter out tags that exhibit contrary predictions between
whole images and their corresponding regions, ensuring a
cleaner and more accurate annotation.

Model: Tag2Text [10] has demonstrated superior image
tagging capabilities by the integration of image tagging and
caption, employing a lightweight recognition decoder [18]
in conjunction with the original image encoder. However,
the effectiveness of Tag2Text is limited to recognizing fixed
and predefined categories. In contrast, RAM enable gener-
alization to previously unseen categories by incorporating
semantic information into label queries. This model design

Figure 3. Illustration of RAM’s model architecture. Large-scale image tags are obtained from image-text pairs through automatic text
semantic parsing. With image-tag-text triplets, RAM unifies the captioning and tagging tasks. Furthermore, RAM introduces an off-
the-shelf text encoder to encoder tags into textual label queries with semantically-rich context, empowering the generalization to unseen

categories in training stage.

allows RAM to empower the recognition capabilities of any
visual dataset, underlining its potential for diverse applica-
tions.

Benefitting from the large-scale, high-quality image-tag-
text data and the synergistic integration of tagging with cap-
tion, we develop a strong recognize anything model (RAM).
RAM represents a new paradigm for image tagging, demon-
strating that a general model trained on noisy, annotation-
free data can outperform fully supervised models. The ad-
vantages of RAM are summarized as follows:

¢ Strong and general. RAM exhibits exceptional image
tagging capabilities with powerful zero-shot general-
ization as illustrated in Figure[2}

¢ Reproducible and affordable. RAM requires Low re-
production cost with open-source and annotation-free
dataset. Moreover, the strongest version of RAM only
requires 3-days 8 A100 GPUs training;

¢ Flexible and versatile. RAM offers remarkable flexi-
bility, catering to various application scenarios. By se-
lecting specific classes, RAM can be directly deployed
to address specific tagging needs. Furthermore, when
combined with localization model (Grounding DINO
and SAM), RAM forms a strong and general pipeline
for visual semantic analysis.

2. Recognize Anything Model
2.1. Model Architecture

As illustrated in Figure[3} we extract image tags through
text semantic parsing, providing a large-scale of tags with-
out expensive manual annotations. The overall architecture

of RAM is similar to that of Tag2Text[10], which consists of
three key modules: an image encoder for feature extraction,
following a image-tag recognition decoder for tagging,
and a text generation encoder-decoder for captioning. The
image features interact with tags by the cross-attention lay-
ers in the image-tag interaction encoder and recognition de-
coder. In the training stage, the recognition head learns
to predict the tags parsed from text, while in the inference
stage, it serves as a image-to-tags bridge by predicting tags
which provide a more explicit semantic guidance to image
captioning.

Compared with Tag2Text [10], RAM’s core advance-
ment in model design is the introduction of open-vocabulary
recognition. Tag2Text can only recognize the categories
that it has seen during training, while RAM can recognize
any category.

2.2. Open-Vocabulary Recognition

Textual Label Queries. Inspired by , the pivotal
enhancement lies in the incorporation of semantic infor-
mation into the label queries of the recognition decoder,
which facilitates generalization to previously unseen cate-
gories in training stage. To achieve this, we utilize an off-
the-shelf text encoder to encode the individual tags from the
tag list, consequently providing textual label queries with
semantically-rich context. In contrast, the label queries em-
ployed in the original recognition decode [| are ran-
domly learnable embeddings, lacking the semantic relation-
ship with unseen categories, thus are confined to predefined
seen categories.

Implementation Details. We adopt Swin-transformer
as the image encoder, as it demonstrated better performance

than naive ViT in both vision-language and tagging do-
mains [18]. The encoder-decoder used for text generation
are 12-layer transformers, and the tag recognition decoder
is a 2-layer transformer. We utilize the off-the-shelf text en-
coder from CLIP and perform prompt ensembling
to obtain textual label queries. We also adopt the CLIP
image encoder to distill image feature, which further im-
proves the model’s recognition ability for unseen categories
via image-text feature alignment.

2.3. Model Efficiency

Training Phase. RAM is pretrained on large-scale datasets
with a resolution of 224 and fine-tuning at a resolution of
384 using small and high-quality datasets. Empirical evi-
dence suggests that RAM converges rapidly, often with con-
vergence achieved after a minimal number of epochs (typ-
ically less than 5 epochs). This accelerated convergence
enhances the reproducibility of RAM with limited compu-
tational resources. To illustrate, the version of RAM pre-
trained on 4 millions necessitate 1-day of computation, and
the strongest version of RAM pretrained on 14 million im-
ages necessitate a mere 3-days of computation on 8 A100
GPUs.

Inference Phase. The lightweight image-tag recognition
decoder effectively ensures the inference efficiency of RAM
on image tagging. Furthermore, we eliminate the self-
attention layers from the recognition decoder, which not

a

only further improves efficiency but also circumvents po-
tential interference between label queries. Consequently,
instead of fixed categories and quantities, RAM allows cus-
tomization of label queries for any category and quantity
which want to automatically recognize, enhancing its util-
ity across various visual tasks and datasets.

3. Data
3.1. Label System

This work adopts three guiding principles for the formu-
lation of the label system: /) Tags that frequently appear in
image-text pairs are more valuable due to their representa-
tional significance in image description. 2) A variety of do-
mains and contexts should be represented in the tags. Our
conception of a tag includes objects, scenes, attributes, and
actions from a range of sources, which aids model gener-
alization to complex, unseen scenarios. 3) The quantity of
tags needs to be moderate. Excessive tag numbers can incur
heavy annotation costs.

Initially, we parse 14 million sentences from our pre-
training datasets into tags by utilizing a SceneGraph-
Parser with minor modifications. We then hand-pick
tags from the top-10k most frequently occurring tags. Our
selection intentionally covers tags from numerous popu-
lar datasets for classification, detection, and segmentation,
as illustrated in Figure While most are fully covered,


--- Page 5 ---
exceptions include ImageNet and OpenImages V6, due to
their unusual tag presence. Additionally, we partially cover
tags from leading tagging products, which were obtained
via public APIs using open-source images. Conse-
quently, RAM can recognize up to 6449 fixed tags, which
is substantially more than Tag2Text [10], and includes a
higher proportion of valuable tags. To reduce redundancy,
we collected synonyms via various methodologies includ-
ing manual checks, referring to WordNet [7], translating
and merging tags, etc. Tags within the same synonym group
are assigned the same tag ID, resulting in 4585 tag IDs in
the label system.

3.2. Datasets

Similar to BLIP and Tag2Text [10], we pre-
train our model on widely-used open-source datasets. 4
million (4M) image and 14 million (14M) image set-
tings are adopted. The 4M setting includes two human-
annotated datasets, COCO [16] (113K images, 557K cap-
tions) and Visual Genome (101K images, 822K cap-
tions), along with two large-scale web-based datasets, Con-
ceptual Captions [6] (3M images, 3M captions) and SBU
Captions [21] (849K images, 849K captions). The 14M set-
ting builds upon the 4M, with the addition of Conceptual
12M [6] (10M images, 10M captions).

3.3. Data Engine

Given the predominantly open-source nature of our train-
ing datasets, which are largely crawled from the Internet, we
encounter a non-negligible amount of missing and incorrect
labels. To mitigate this, we design an automatic data engine
to generate additional tags and clean erroneous ones.

Generation. Our initial step involves training a baseline
model using the captions and tags parsed from these cap-
tions, similar to the approach used in Tag2Text [10J. We
then leverage this baseline model to supplement both the
captions and tags, utilizing its generative and tagging capa-
bilities, respectively. The original captions and tags, in con-
junction with the generated captions, corresponding parsed
tags, and generated tags, are merged to form a temporary
dataset. This step significantly expands the number of tags
in the 4M image dataset from 12 million to 39.8 million.

Cleaning. To address the issue of incorrect tags, we initially
employ Grounding-Dino to identify and crop regions
corresponding to a specific category within all images. Sub-
sequently, we cluster the regions from this category based
on K-Means++ [4] and eliminate the tags associated with
the outlier 10%. Simultaneously, we also remove tags with-
out the prediction of this specific category using the baseline
model. The motivation is that the precision of tagging mod-
els can be improved by predicting regions rather than whole
images.

4. Experiment
4.1. Experimental Setting

Test Benchmarks. We conducted a comprehensive evalu-
ation of the models on various popular benchmark datasets
across different computer vision tasks, including classifica-
tion, detection, and segmentation, as summarized in Table[f]
For classification, we adopt the OpenImages V6 [14], which
contains 9605 categories. However, due to issues of miss-
ing labels and incorrect annotations within the OpenImages
dataset, we curated two high-quality subsets: OpenImages-
common, comprising 214 well-annotated common cate-
gories, and OpenImages-rare, consisting of 200 categories
not included in our label system for open-set experiments.
Additionally, to facilitate better zero-shot evaluation, we
employed an internal test set known as OPPO-common,
which exhibits high annotation quality.

For detection and segmentation datasets, we selected
the widely recognized COCO and ADE20k
datasets. In these datasets, we focused solely on seman-
tic labels as image-level tagging ground-truth, disregard-
ing bounding boxes and masks. It is important to note that
ADE20k contains plenty of very small ground-truth anno-
tations and ambiguous categories that deviate from main-
stream concepts, e.g., “buffet”. Thus, we created a subset
of ADE20k called ADE20k-clean by removing a few small
targets and ambiguous categories.

Evaluation Metrics. To assess the performance of the
models, we employed various evaluation metrics. Mean
Average Precision (mAP) was used for reporting results in
ablation experiments and comparisons with other classifica-
tion models. For models where mAP was not available, we
utilized Precision/Recall metrics and manually adjusted the
threshold of different models to ensure comparability across
evaluations.

eralize beyond its specialized field. Specifically, the su-
pervised expert model ML-Decoder [23] excels in its des-
ignated domain of expertise, OpenImages, but faces chal-
lenges in generalizing to other domains and unseen cate-
gories. MKT [8] is a generalist model in tagging by trans-
ferring the knowledge from CLIP, fails to achieve satisfac-
tory accuracy across all domains. Tag2Text is powerful
at zero-shot tagging, but it lacks the ability to handle open-
set scenarios.

RAM exhibits impressive tagging abilities, showcasing
impressive accuracy and broad coverage. Particularly note-
worthy is the performance of RAM-4M, which surpasses
ML-Decoder on the OpenImages-common dataset. While
ML-Decoder relies on 9 million annotated images from
OpenImages, our RAM-4M achieves higher accuracy with
a training set of 4 million annotation-free image-text data.
This improvement is attributed to the utilization of 39.3
million common tags derived from the 4 million images,
outperforming ML-Decoder trained with only 33.9 million

common tags from 9 million images. Moreover, RAM can
recognize any common category by leveraging a vast range
of 6,400+ seen common categories, coupled with its open-
vocabulary ability.

Comparison with Detection and Segmentation Models.
The comparison in TableBB|reveals that supervised detection
and segmentation models excel in specific domains such
as COCO datasets, which encompass a limited number of
categories. However, these models face challenges when it
comes to recognizing a larger number of categories. On the
one hand, they take much more computational overheads
as they requires more complex network and larger input im-
age sizes for extra localization task. Especially, ODISE [26]
takes long inference time due to its adoption of the diffusion
model and large input image resolution. On the other hand,
the scalability of training data for detection and segmenta-
tion is limited, resulting in poor generalization performance
for these models. Although Grounding-DINO serve
as a generalist model, it struggles to achieve satisfactory

performance for large-sized categories. In contrast, RAM
demonstrates impressive open-set ability, surpassing exist-
ing detection and segmentation models. RAM showcases
its capability to generalize across a broader range of cate-
gories, providing a robust solution for the challenges faced
by conventional detection and segmentation models.

Compared with Vision-Language Models. Despite
the open-set recognition capabilities of CLIP [22] and
BLIP [15], these models suffer from subpar accuracy. Fur-
thermore, their interpretability is limited, as they rely on
cosine similarity computations of dense embeddings for
image-text pairs. In contrast, RAM exhibits superior per-
formance, surpassing CLIP and BLIP by a significant mar-
gin, with accuracy increases of over 20% observed across
almost all datasets. However, it is worth noting that RAM
performs slightly worse than CLIP and BLIP in the case of
OpenImages-rare dataset. We attribute this discrepancy to
the smaller training dataset utilized for RAM and the rela-
tively less emphasis placed on rare classes during training.

4.3. Model Ablation Study

In Table [4 we study the impact of various model im-
provements to RAM based on Tag2Text and make
the following key observations. /) The training integra-
tion of captioning and tagging can promote the tagging abil-
ity. 2) The open-set recognition capability can be achieved

through textual queries by CLIP [22], but has little impact
on the seen categories in training. 3) The expansion of the
label system introduces minimal impact on existing cate-
gories, which can be attributed to the additional categories
increases the difficulty of model training. However, this
expansion concurrently enhances the model’s coverage and
enhances the open-set ability of unseen categories.

4.4, Data Engine Ablation Study

We present an ablation study of the data engine in Table
The findings are summarized as follows: /) Adding more
tags from 12.0M to 41.7M significantly improves model
performance across all test sets, indicating the severe miss-
ing label problem in original datasets. 2) Further cleaning
the tags of some categories results in a slight increase in per-
formance on the OPPO-common and OpenImages-common
test sets. Limited by the inference speed of Grounding-
Dino, we only conduct cleaning process for 534 categories.
3) Scaling up the training images from 4M to 14M brings
remarkable improvements across all test sets. 4) Employ-
ing a larger backbone network leads to a slight improve-
ment on OpenImages-rare and even slightly inferior per-
formance on common categories. We attribute this phe-
nomenon to our insufficient resources available for conduct-
ing hyper-parameter search. 5) Fine-tuning with tags parsed
from the COCO Caption dataset demonstrates remark-
able increases in performance on the OPPO-common and

OpenImages-common test sets. The COCO Caption dataset
provides five descriptive sentences for each image, offering
a comprehensive description that approximates a complete
set of tag labels.

5. Conclusion

We present the Recognize Anything Model (RAM), a
strong foundation model designed for image tagging, which
heralds a novel paradigm in this field. RAM demonstrate
the zero-shot ability to recognize any category with high
accuracy, surpassing the performance of both fully super-
vised models and existing generalist approaches like CLIP
and BLIP. RAM represents a considerable advancement for
large-scale models in the field of computer vision, holding
the potential to empower the recognition capabilities of any
visual tasks or datasets.

There still exists room for further refinement of RAM.
For example, scaling up the training dataset beyond 14 mil-
lion images to better cover diverse domains, multiple rounds
of data engine, increasing the backbone parameters to en-
hance the model capacity.

Limitations. Similar to CLIP, the current version of
RAM efficiently recognizes common objects and scenes,
yet struggles with abstract tasks like object counting. More-
over, zero-shot RAM’s performance lags behind task-
specific models in fine-grained classifications, such as dif-
ferentiating between car models or identifying specific
flower or bird species. It is also noteworthy that RAM is
trained on open-source datasets and could potentially reflect
dataset biases.
