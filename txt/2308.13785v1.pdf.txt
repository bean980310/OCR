Abstract

Avoiding synthesizing specific visual concepts is an essential
challenge in responsible visual synthesis. However, the visual
concept that needs to be avoided for responsible visual syn-
thesis tends to be diverse, depending on the region, context,
and usage scenarios. In this work, we formalize a new task,
Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (44 ORES),
where the synthesis model is able to avoid forbidden visual
concepts while allowing users to input any desired content.
To address this problem, we present a Two-stage Intervention
(TIN) framework. By introducing 1) rewriting with learnable
instruction through a large-scale language model (LLM) and
2) synthesizing with prompt intervention on a diffusion syn-
thesis model, it can effectively synthesize images avoiding
any concepts but following the user’s query as much as pos-
sible. To evaluate on ORES, we provide a publicly available
dataset, baseline models, and benchmark. Experimental re-
sults demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing
risks of image generation. Our work highlights the potential
of LLMs in responsible visual synthesis. Our code and dataset
is public available in https://github.com/kodenii/ORES.

1 Introduction

With the development of large-scale model training, visual
synthesis models are capable of generating increasingly re-
alistic images (Ramesh et al. 2021; Rombach et al. 2022;
Saharia et al. 2022). Due to the growing risk of misuse
of synthesized images, responsible AI has become increas-
ingly important (Arrieta et al. 2020; Wearn, Freeman, and
Jacoby 2019; Smith et al. 2022), especially to avoid some
visual features, such as, nudity, sexual discrimination, and
racism, during synthesis. However, responsible visual syn-
thesis is a highly challenging task for two main reasons.
First, to meet the administrators’ requirements, the prohib-
ited visual concepts and their referential expressions must
not appear in the synthesized images, e.g., “Bill Gates”
and “Microsoft’s founder”. Second, to satisfy the
users’ requirements, the non-prohibited parts of a user’s
query should be synthesized as accurately as possible.

To address the above issues, existing responsible visual
synthesis methods can be categorized into three primary
approaches: refining inputs, refining outputs, and refining

models. The first approach, refining inputs (Jung and Sit
2004), focuses on pre-processing the user query to meet
the requirements of administrators, such as implementing
a blacklist to filter out inappropriate content. However, the
blacklist is hard to guarantee the complete elimination of all
unwanted elements in an open-vocabulary setting. The sec-
ond approach, refining outputs, involves post-processing the
generated videos to comply with administrator guidelines,
for example, by detecting and filtering Not-Safe-For-Work
(NSFW) content to ensure the appropriateness of the output
(Rombach et al. 2022). However, this method relies on a fil-
tering model pre-trained on specific concepts, which makes
it challenging to detect open-vocabulary visual concepts. Fi
nally, the third approach, refining models (Gandikota et al.
2023; Kumari et al. 2023), aims at fine-tuning the whole or
the part of models to learn and satisfy the administrator’s re-
quirements, thus enhancing the model’s ability to adhere to
the desired guidelines and produce content that aligns with
the established rules and policies. However, these methods
are often limited by the biases of tuning data, making it dif-
ficult to achieve open-vocabulary capabilities.

This leads us to the following question: How can open-
vocabulary responsible visual synthesis be achieved, al-
lowing administrators to genuinely prohibit the generation
of arbitrary visual concepts? As an example in Figure 1,
a user may ask to generate “Microsoft’s founder
is drinking wine in a bar”. When the adminis-

trator set the forbidden concepts as “Bill Gates” or
“alcohol”, the responsible output should avoid corre-
sponding concepts described in natural language.

Based on the above observations, we propose a new
task as Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (
ORES), where the visual synthesis model is capable of
avoiding arbitrary visual features not explicitly specified
while allowing users to input any desired content. We then
present the Two-stage Intervention (TIN) framework. By in-
troducing 1) rewriting with learnable instruction through a
large-scale language model (LLM) and 2) synthesizing with
prompt intervention on a diffusion synthesis model, it can
effectively synthesize images avoiding specific concepts but
following the user’s query as much as possible. Specifi-
cally, TIN applies CHATGPT (OpenAI 2022) to rewriting
the user’s query to a de-risked query under the guidance of a
learnable query, and then intervenes in the synthesizing pro-
cess by changing the user’s query with the de-risked query
in the intermediate step of synthesizing.

We create a publicly available dataset and build a bench-
mark along with corresponding baseline models, BLACK
LisT and NEGATIVE PROMPT. To the best of our knowl-
edge, we are the first to explore responsible visual synthesis
in an open-vocabulary setting, combining large-scale lan-
guage models and visual synthesis models. Our code and
dataset is public available in the appendix.

Our contributions are as follows:

¢ We propose the new task of Open-vocabulary Respon-
sible Visual Synthesis (4 ORES) with demonstrating
its feasibility. We create a publicly available dataset and
build a benchmark with corresponding baseline models.

¢ We introduce the Two-stage Intervention (TIN) frame-
work, consisting of 1) rewriting with learnable instruc-
tion through a large-scale language model (LLM) and 2)
synthesizing with prompt intervention on a diffusion syn-
thesis model, as an effective solution for ORES.

¢ Experiments show that our method significantly reduces
the risk of inappropriate model generations. We show the
potential of LLMs in responsible visual synthesis.

2 Related Work

Responsible Visual Synthesis In recent years, respon-
sible visual synthesis has gained significant attention.
Some works (Rombach et al. 2022) use Not-Safe-For-Work
(NSFW) classifier to filter out risky output. However, this
needs extra time to re-generate new images and relies on
a filtering model pre-trained on specific concepts, which
makes it challenging to detect open-vocabulary visual con-
cepts. STABLE DIFFUSION (Rombach et al. 2022) offers a
method that continuously mitigate the features described by
the negative prompts during the synthesis process. However,
this method can only suppress the features and not com-
pletely remove them. At the same time, methods based on
machine unlearning have also shown promising results. Ku-
mari et al. (2023) train the hidden state of sentences con-
taining specified concept be closer to those without such
concept. This can remove the model’s capability to gen-
erate specific concept. (Gandikota et al. 2023) align the
model’s hidden states in specific concept with the hidden
states in an empty prompt, to make the ability to gener-
ate specific concept is removed. Zhang et al. (2023a) pro-
posed FORGET-ME-NOT which suppresses specific concept
in cross-attention to eliminate generating. However, these
methods require separate training for different concepts,
which is hard to achieve open-vocabulary capabilities.

Large Language Models Recently, with the emergence of
LLAMA (Touvron et al. 2023), CHATGPT (OpenAI 2022),
and VICUNA (Ding et al. 2023), Large Language Mod-
els have gradually attracted the attention of researchers.
Through the use of chain-of-thoughts and in-context learn-
ing, they have demonstrated powerful zero-shot and few-
shot reasoning abilities (Wei et al. 2022; Kojima et al. 2022;
Zhou et al. 2022). Expanding large language models into the
multi-modal domain has shown their potential in visual un-
derstanding and generation (Zhang et al. 2023b; Gao et al.
2023; Lu et al. 2023). However, the above-mentioned meth-
ods require manually designed prompts and lack of explo-
ration in responsible visual synthesis.

3  & ORES: Open-vocabulary Responsible
Visual Synthesis
3.1. Problem Formulation

Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (€ ORES)
aims to generate an image under the user’s query wu that
meets two criteria: 1) it should not contain a specified visual
concept, represented as c, which is defined by the adminis-
trator in practice, and 2) it should undergo minimal changes
compared to the image I, generated by original user query
directly. The goal is to generate an output image J* that sat-
isfies these requirements, effectively avoiding the specified
concept while preserving the overall visual content.

3.2 Method: Two-stage Intervention (TIN)

As shown in Figure 2, the Two-stage Intervention (TIN)
framework can be divided into two stages: (1) rewriting with
learnable instruction, where the user query wu and the admin-
istrator’s forbidden concept c are used to generate a new de-
risked query u’ with a high probability of not containing c
via a LLM, where a learnable instruction is used for guid-
ance, and (2) synthesizing with prompt intervention, where
the original user query u and the new de-risked query wu’
are used to generate an image that satisfies the user’s query
while avoiding administrator’s forbidden concept c.

Preliminary A diffusion model uses T’ steps of the diffu-
sion process to transform an image x° into noise x7 follow-
ing a Gaussian distribution!. To synthesize image, we per-
form an inverse diffusion process (Song, Meng, and Ermon
2020) using the user’s query wu as a condition prompt:

x' 1 = f(x',u), (1)

where f is the function for the inverse diffusion process.
Therefore, we randomly sample noise as x? and apply
Equation 1 step by step to obtain the final output x°, which
is the generated image under the user’s query wu.

The key challenges are 1) how to make generated image
responsible and 2) how to make generated image as similar
with user’s query as possible.

Rewriting with Learnable Instruction As user’s query u
may contain forbidden concept c set by administrator, we
use LLM to rewrite u to a de-risked query u’. However,
we cannot train LLM for this task as inaccessible parameter
and training cost. To tackle with the first challenge, we pro-
pose LEARNABLE INSTRUCTION to construct the guidance
prompt, i.e., instruction text, helping LLM achieve this.
Instead of manually designing the instruction, which re-
quires much more human effort and may not be effective,
we let LLM initialize the instruction and update the instruc-
tion itself. We pre-designed a small manual training dataset,
which contains 16 groups of samples, each consisting of a
user query u, an administrator’s forbidden concept c, and 3
different ground-truth answers of the de-risked query. This
small dataset will help LLM find out general solution and

'We use image generation as the example, but our method can
be extended to most diffusion-based visual synthesis tasks. Refer
to Section 4.8 for more details.

summarize to instruction text. Note that the manual dataset
does not contain any sample in the evaluation dataset.

The learning consists of several epochs and each epoch
consists of a few steps. In j-th step of instruction learning,
we concatenate instruction p; with the k-th pair of admin-
istrator’s forbidden concept c;, and user query wu, in dataset
and then let LLM generate the predicted query ¢i,:

th, = 9 (Ck. URs Pj) (2)

where g represents an LLM. We repeat this process in
a mini-batch of the dataset to obtain a group of results.
We combine these concepts, user queries, LLM-generated
queries, and the correct answers from the dataset to a packed
result r; with linefeed.

During learning phrase, LLM use prompt p'"** to extend
the task description p**** to an initial instruction prompt po:

po = g(p'***; p™*), (3)

Then we use prompt p°?* to ask LLM update p;_1 to p;
with the packed result r;_; and learning history h:

Pj = 9'j—-1,Pj-1: Ph), (4)

where h is initially empty text and added previous instruc-
tion iteratively. This update process allows LLM to consider
history to better optimize instruction stably.

By repeating the above steps, we obtain updated instruc-
tions pi, p2,..-,;Pn, Where n is the total number of learn-
ing steps. Then we retain the learnable instruction p,, as p,
which is the final instruction we use. For more details of pre-
defined prompts p'***, pi", and p°P*, refer to Appendix.

Similar to machine learning, we only need learn the in-
struction p for once and this instruction p can be used for
any administrator’s forbidden concept c or user’s query wu.
LLM can generates de-risked query wu’ based on administra-
tor’s forbidden concept c, and the user’s query u. This makes
that the synthesized image does not contain the concept c.

Synthesizing with Prompt Intervention During synthe-
sizing, LLM’s de-risked query u’ often does not follow the
user’s query u closely. To tackle with the second challenge,
therefore, we propose PROMPT INTERVENTION.

We synthesize under the user’s query for a few initial
steps, i.e., satisfiable steps. Then we intervene in the condi-
tion prompt for the synthesis model to de-risked query and
continue synthesizing, i.e., responsible steps. Let S' be the
number of satisfiable steps, which is a hyper-parameter.

For satisfiable steps x" ,x7-!,...,x7~5, given the user
input wu, the diffusion model performs T — S' steps of inverse
diffusion process with user’s query u as the condition:

x t= fx), T-S<i<T. (5)

Then, we call LLM to obtain a new query wu’ and con-

tinue the inverse diffusion process as responsible steps
xT-S._..,x!,x° for obeying administrator’s policy:

x t= fx), 0<i<T-S. (6)

Finally, the obtained x° is the final output image I°, and
I; is a responsible output.

4 Experiments
4.1 Dataset Setup

We randomly sampled 100 distinct images from the Visual
Genome (Krishna et al. 2017) dataset to obtain potential vi-
sual concepts that may be present in them, which served as
the content to be removed. Next, to simulate diverse user
inputs in real-world scenarios, we used the CHATGPT API
to generate several objects that could potentially be related
to these visual concepts. Generated objects were manually
filtered, resulting in 100 sets of concept-object pairs. Sub-
sequently, we employed the CHATGPT API to generate de-
scriptions for the objects for each concept-object pair, aim-
ing to include the corresponding concept as much as possi-
ble. The generated sentences were again manually reviewed,
resulting in a final set of 100 high-quality and diverse com-
binations of concepts, objects, and image descriptions. To
make the dataset more representative of real-world scenar-
ios, some image descriptions may implicitly include the con-
cepts or even omit them.

4.2 Evaluation Metrics

We employ machine evaluation and human evaluation to
analyze the synthesized results comprehensively. Both ma-
chine evaluation and human evaluation measure the results
from two different perspectives: evasion ratio and visual
similarity. Refer to Appendix for more evaluation details.

Evasion Ratio The purpose of the evasion ratio is to test
whether the model is responsible, i.e., to determine the prob-
ability that the generated image avoids a specific concept. If
the synthesized image does not contain the given concept
c to be evaded, it is considered a successful evasion; other-
wise, it is considered a failed evasion. For machine evalu-

ation, we convert it into a Visual Question Answering, i.e.,
VQA task (Antol et al. 2015). We use the BLIP-2 (Li et al.
2023) model as the discriminator. For human evaluation, we
present the image along with the concept displayed on the
screen and ask them to answer a similar question.

Visual Similarity The purpose of visual similarity is to
measure the model’s compliance with user query, i.e., the
deviates of the synthesized image with a specific concept
avoided from the image the user wants to synthesize. First,
we synthesize an image using the user’s query and the ad-
ministrator’s forbidden concept under the responsible sce-
nario. Then, we synthesize another image using only the user
prompt without following the responsible policy. We com-
pare the differences between these two images. For machine
evaluation, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) function
to calculate the pixel distance between the two images and
normalize it to a range of 0 to 1 (0 for absolute difference
and 1 for absolute same). To avoid extreme values in cases
of a very low evasion ratio, the similarity is always set to
0.5 if the evasion fails. For human evaluation, we present
the images synthesized under the responsible scenario and
non-responsible scenario and ask volunteers to judge.

4.3 Experiments Setup

To validate the superiority of our approach, we constructed
two widely used methods as baselines: BLACK LIST: by
removing the administrator’s forbidden concept in the sen-
tence, the generation model may avoid synthesizing the
specified concept; NEGATIVE PROMPT: in each DDIM step
of synthesizing, enhance the hidden state by strengthening
the difference from forbidden concept and user’s query. Re-
fer to Appendix for more implementation details.

For each sample in the dataset, we performed 5 runs on

different random seed independently called the CHATGPT
API to reduce the randomness of the experiments.

4.4 Overall Results

Quantitative Analysis As shown in Table 1, our approach
demonstrates significant performance compared to the base-
line methods. In terms of evasion ratio, our method achieved
an 85.6% success rate, while the BLACK LIST method
achieved only about 2% success rate, and the NEGATIVE
PROMPT method achieved less than 40% accuracy. This
is because most of the time, the concept is not explicitly
present in the user’s query (see Sec.4.7 for more details).
Regarding the NEGATIVE PROMPT, the results in the table
indicate that this approach still has limited effectiveness in
such complex scenarios. In terms of visual similarity, our
method also maintains high visual similarity while maintain-
ing a high evasion ratio, which demonstrates the superiority
of our approach. Thanks to the support of LLM, our method
can effectively handle ORES.

Qualitative Analysis How does our method compare to
the baseline method in terms of visual effects?) We present
some examples in Figure 3. As shown in the first group,
our method generates images with both layouts and con-
tent that are very similar to the original image, success-
fully avoiding the appearance of “golden brown”. For
the BLACK LIST, we found that it fails to remove this con-
cept because the word “caramelized” in the sentence has
the same meaning. Therefore, even if the word “golden”
is removed, the image still contains content similar to it.

As for the NEGATIVE PROMPT, although the concept of
“golden brown” is somewhat mitigated, it is not com-
pletely removed. Furthermore, in some examples, not only
were the concepts not successfully removed, but the im-
age content also underwent significant changes. In contrast,
our method successfully removes the concept of “golden
brown” while maintaining a high similarity between the
generated image and the user’s query. In the second ex-
ample, we found that both the BLACK LIST and NEGA-
TIVE PROMPT failed because the sentence is strongly related
to “stainless-steel” making it difficult to remove.
However, our method successfully removes this feature and
maintains a highly impressive similarity. This demonstrates
that our method also exhibits excellent visual effects. Refer
to Appendix for additional ORES samples.

4.5 Ablation Study

Quantitative Analysis To validate the effectiveness of the
framework, we conducted ablation experiments. As shown
in Table 2, we can find that LEARNABLE INSTRUCTION
plays a decisive role in the evasion ratio. Without using
LEARNABLE INSTRUCTION, our accuracy was only 28.8%.
However, with its implementation, there was an improve-
ment of approximately 60%. This is because removing
specified concepts while maintaining as much unchanged
meaning of the sentence as possible is extremely challeng-
ing. Without the guidance of learned instructions, the LLM
struggles to understand and execute tasks correctly. On the
other hand, we discovered that PROMPT INTERVENTION is
crucial for visual similarity. This is because the initial steps
of DDIM determine the overall content and composition of
the image. Ensuring their similarity guarantees consistency

between the generated image and the user input. By combin-
ing these two factors, we achieved a final model with both a
high evasion ratio and visual similarity

Qualitative Analysis What is the role of different mod-
ules in terms of visual effects? We have selected some ex-
amples to illustrate this. As shown in Figure 4, in the first ex-
ample, we found that without LEARNABLE INSTRUCTION,
the “Cloudy” feature was not effectively removed. Despite
the high similarity between the image and the original image
generated directly from the user input, the core task of ORES
was not accomplished. In the example without PROMPT
INTERVENTION, although the feature was completely re-
moved, the entire image underwent significant changes com-
pared to the original image. By combining both, we can
maintain a high similarity while successfully removing spe-
cific features. In the second example, we observed that with-
out LEARNABLE INSTRUCTION, there were some imper-
ceptible “frosted” elements, such as snowflakes, when
the image was enlarged. When PROMPT INTERVENTION
was not used, the image experienced excessive changes in
both perspective composition and content. Conversely, by
combining both, we can simultaneously completely remove
specific features while maintaining a high similarity. This
demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. For further
study on LEARNABLE INSTRUCTION and PROMPT INTER-
VENTION, refer to Appendix.

4.6 Comparisons with LLM-based Methods

To explore the differences from traditional LLM-based ap-
proaches, we adopt different methods to design instruc-
tion: HUMAN DESIGN: Instruction designed manually based
on task objectives. IN-CONTEXT LEARNING (Brown et al.
2020): Instead of providing instruction of guidance, we
present all samples that were used to learn instruction. We
employed PROMPT INTERVENTION for all methods to con-
trol variables. As shown in Table 3, we observe that IN-
CONTEXT LEARNING has a relatively low evasion ratio in

Table 3: Comparisons with LLM-based methods on ma-
chine evaluation. We surpass prior methods significantly.

MODEL EVASION RATIO’ VISUAL SIMILARITY?
HUMAN DESIGN 61.1% 0.576
IN-CONTEXT LEARNING 28.8% 0.530
TIN (ouRS) 85.6% 0.593

this task. This could be attributed to the task’s complexity
and significant differences from the training stage of lan-
guage models. On the other hand, HUMAN DESIGN exhibits
better results, but it still falls short in terms of evasion ratio
compared to our method. Additionally, HUMAN DESIGN re-
quires additional human resources in designing prompts for
LLM. This demonstrates the superiority of our approach.

4.7 Results of LLM Rewritting

In order to explore why LLM can effectively help us with
ORES, we presented some results of LLM outputs. Please
note that since CHATGPT API may return different results
with each call, what we show here is one of the possible gen-
erated results. As shown in Figure 5, LLM successfully re-
moves the given concept from the user’s query. We observe
that LLM can understand synonyms, antonyms, and concep-
tual relationships correctly, which significantly enhances the
model’s usability and robustness. Moreover, we also notice
that LLM not only removes the concept itself but also modi-
fies words or phrases related to those concepts. This demon-
strates the powerful language capabilities of LLM.

4.8 Extending to Other Tasks

ORES involves multiple tasks, and our method not only
serves image generation but also directly works for various
tasks without any modifications. We conducted experiments
in four common tasks within the visual synthesis: (a) im-
age generation, (b) image editing, (c) image inpainting, and

Image Editing As shown in Figure 6 (b), our method suc-
cessfully avoids the violent synthesis of images. The IN-

lowed the user’s request to synthesize a vividly burning
house, but the potential violent elements could lead to ethi-
cal issues with the image. Our method successfully prevents
the synthesis of a burning house and, to some extent, ad-
heres to the user’s request by providing a damaged house,
significantly reducing the risk of generating violent images.

Image Inpainting As shown in Figure 6 (c), our method
does not synthesize content that may include brand trade-
marks. The original CONTROLNET (Zhang and Agrawala
2023) generated an interface highly similar to the Windows
8 start screen, but Windows 8 was never released on the
hardware depicted in the image, which could pose a risk of
commercial infringement. Our method avoids generating re-
sponsibly and ensures the quality of image inpainting.

Video Generation As shown in Figure 6 (d), our method
does not synthesize content that may contain copyrighted
characters. The original VIDEOFUSION (Luo et al. 2023)
generated high-quality videos that match the user’s queries,

but considering the user input in the image, there might be
copyrighted characters, which could lead to copyright risks.
Our method replaces copyrighted characters with ordinary
people without copyright issues while maintaining a high
similarity in the video content.

5 Conclusion

This paper proposed a novel task termed Open-vocabulary
Responsible Visual Synthesis (€ ORES), wherein the syn-
thesis model must refrain from incorporating unspecified vi-
sual elements while still accommodating user inputs of di-
verse content. To tackle this issue, we designed Two-stage
Intervention (TIN) framework, which encompassed two key
stages: 1) rewriting with learnable instruction and 2) syn-
thesizing with prompt intervention on a diffusion synthesis
model and a large-scale language model (LLM). TIN can
effectively synthesize images avoiding specific concepts but
following the user’s query as much as possible. To evaluate
on ORES, we conducted a publicly available dataset, bench-
mark, and baseline models. Experimental results demon-
strated the effectiveness of our method in reducing risky im-
age generation risks. Our work highlighted the potential of
LLMs in responsible visual synthesis. For ethics statement,

A Evaluation Details

Evasion Ratio For machine evaluation, we convert it
into a VQA task, where for each image, we provide
the image along with the prompt “Q: Is there any
{concept} in the image? A: ” as input to the
model to obtain a Yes/No answer, which determines
whether the feature appears in the image. For human eval-
uation, we present the image with the concept on the screen
and ask them to answer Yes/No in “Is there any
{concept} in the image?”. The results are calcu-
lated as a percentage, which serves as the final metric.

Visual Similarity For machine evaluation, we use the
Mean Squared Error (MSE) function to calculate the pixel
distance between the responsible image J¢ with risky image
I, and normalize it:

i = Lal
WxHxC’

where W, H, and C are the number width, height, and chan-
nel of the image. To avoid extreme values in cases of a
very low evasion ratio, the similarity is always set to 0.5
if the evasion fails. For human evaluation, we present the
images synthesized under the responsible scenario and non-
responsible scenario and ask volunteers to judge with the
following scores:

score =

(7)

¢ 1: similar content,

¢ 0: irrelevant content, and

* 0.5: relevance but significant different or failed evasion.
The average results are used as the final metric.

B_ Implementation Details
B.1_ Black List

We match the concept in the user’s query and replace it with
the empty string “”. We use STABLE DIFFUSION V2.1? to
generate the image in 768 x 768.

B.2. Negative Prompt

Following STABLE DIFFUSION (Rombach et al. 2022), we
obtain the hidden state by the user’s query and concept we
need to avoid:

i-1 i
xp | = f(x',u),
x, = f(x',0). °

*https://github.com/Stability- AI/StableDiffusion

We enhance the hidden state x‘~! by strengthening the dif-
ference of hidden state from the forbidden concept and the
user’s query:

-1 i-1 -1 i-1
xT = a(x, — xy) +X (9)

where a is a hyper-parameter and set to 13. We use STABLE
DIFFUSION V2.1 to generate the image in 768 x 768.

B.3 Our TIN Framework

Prompt of Task Description p A user will
input an image and concept(s), you
should generate a new image thoroughly
replace given concept to the opposite
one. As you cannot access image
directly, user will use image caption
instead. You should also output image
caption in a short sentence with few
words. Skip concept(s) irrelevant to

the image. The input is always valid.

task

Prompt of Instruction Initialization p' You are
working to help other LLM to complete
the task. Task Description: {Task
Description} You can formulate some
rules or steps. You should generate
instruction prompt for the LLM to
complete this task.

Prompt of Instruction Update p°?' Here are
results from the LLM. You can formulate
some rules or steps. Update or rewrite
the instruction for it based on your
evaluation.

We update instruction for 2 epochs. We set 7’ to 20, which
is the same with STABLE DIFFUSION. S is set to 2 in main
experiments. We use STABLE DIFFUSION V2.1 to generate
an image in 768 x 768.

C_ Extra Samples of ORES

We provide extra samples of ORES to show the effectiveness
of our framework in Figure 7. We can observe that ORES is
a difficult task for BLACK LIST because forbidden concepts
have a strong relationship with the whole user’s query and
are hard to remove directly. Meanwhile, we also notice that
NEGATIVE PROMPT can alleviate these concepts but can-
not avoid them thoroughly. Our framework can avoid these
concepts with keeping very similar visual content.

D_ Exploration of Prompt Intervention

Why can we keep the content of the image similar
to the user’s query even if we modified it? We pro-
vide visualization on PROMPT INTERVENTION in Fig-
ure 8 with user’s query “a man in warm suit at
the forest” and LLM’s de-risked query “a man
in snowsuit at the forest”. We can find that
PROMPT INTERVENTION plays the key role. When S, the
number of satisfiable steps, is larger, the image will be more
similar to the user’s query. In contrast, when S' is smaller,
the image will be more similar to LLM’s de-risked query

and be more responsible. Based on this phenomenon, we se-
lected the intermediate number to make the image not only
responsible but also similar to the user’s query.

E_ Exploration of Learnable Instruction

E.1 Influence of Learning Paradigm

Is the paradigm of LEARNABLE INSTRUCTION effective?
We conducted a series of experiments to address this ques-
tion in Table 4. Firstly, we removed the learning history,
which resulted in a significant decrease in performance. This
is because, without the learning history, the model is unable
to maintain optimization continuity, similar to oscillations
in deep learning, ultimately leading to optimization failure.
Additionally, we also attempted to disable the mini-batch,
causing the LLM to only observe the results and correct an-
swers of one sample of data at one time. We find this also
led to a decline in model performance, making it challeng-
ing for the model to construct and update instruction simul-
taneously and consequently resulting in poor performance.

E.2 Exploration of Epoch

We further investigate the relationship between the num-
ber of learning epochs and performance. As shown in Ta-
ble 5, we observe that as the number of epochs increases,

Table 5: Study of learning epochs on machine evaluation.

EpocH EVASION RATIO’ VISUAL SIMILARITY*
0 82.4% 0.584
1 83.3% 0.589
2 85.6% 0.593
3 719.2% 0.587

the model’s performance gradually improves, which aligns
with our expectations: the model progressively discovers the
correct optimization direction of instruction from the small
training data and generates more effective instructions. On
the other hand, we find that the model’s performance starts
to decline after exceeding 2 epochs, indicating that the opti-
mization limit of the model has been reached.

E.3 Learned Instruction

What exactly does LLM initialize and learn? We demon-
strate the instructions initialized and learned by the LLM,
as shown in Figure 9. We find that the LLM self-initialized
instruction is very effective for guidance, which includes
most of the important steps. This can show the effective-
ness of LLM self-initialized instruction. Additionally, the
learned instruction emphasizes the task content more in the
steps and provides specific information for ambiguous in-
structions. Furthermore, the LLM has even learned to skip
irrelevant concepts, enhancing the generality of the instruc-
tion and resulting in improved performance.

--- Page 12 ---
F Code and Dataset

We released code, dataset, and learned instructions? under
the MIT license. We also designed a WebUI with Gradio
(Abid et al. 2019) for better illustration. Note that you may
need to provide an OpenAI API key to access their server.

LLM Self-initialized Instruction

Today, we will be working on generating images with opposite
concepts. Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Ask the user to input an image caption and concept (s).
2. Identify the relevant concepts from the image caption.

3. Thoroughly replace the given concepts with their opposite
ones. For example, if the concept is “dark”, replace it with
"Light".

4. Generate a new image based on the modified caption.

5. Output the new image caption in a short sentence with few
words. Make sure to include the opposite concepts in the
sentence.

Happy generating!

LLM Self-learned Instruction

Va

Welcome to the task of generating images with opposite concepts.
Follow these steps to complete the task:

1, Start by asking the user to input an image caption and the
concept (s) they would like to replace with their opposite ones.
2. Identify relevant concepts from the given caption and specify
which concepts to replace.

3. Thoroughly replace the specified concepts with their opposite
ones. For instance, if the concept is "dark," replace it with
"Light."

4. Generate a new image based on the modified caption.

5. Output the new image caption in a short sentence with few
words. Make sure to include the opposite concepts in the
sentence.

6. If any irrelevant concepts are present, skip them and
continue with the relevant ones.

Happy generating!

G_ Ethics Statement
We provide ethics review in the following aspects.

Data We build our benchmark dataset based on public
Visual Genome (Krishna et al. 2017) dataset and applying
CHATGPT (OpenAI 2022) to generate query. We manually
review the data to try our best to avoid ethical risks.

Reproducibility We build our model based on public
STABLE DIFFUSION V2.1 repository and checkpoint. How-
ever, we notice that OpenAl’s API cannot ensure generate
the same response even with the same input. Therefore, we
also provide learned instruction to help reproduce.

Privacy, Discrimination and Other Ethical Issues In
our dataset, we use general concepts, e.g. laughing,
computer, and dark, to simulate the real scenario to
avoid ethical risk. We reviewed the dataset and removed any
samples with harmful content.

H_ Broader Impact and Limitations

Due to the widespread and increasingly powerful applica-
tions of deep learning, the misuse of visual synthesis models

$https://github.com/kodenii/ORES

is having a growing impact on the international community.
Examples include the proliferation of fake news, defamatory
images, and the emergence of illegal content. As a result, re-
sponsible AI has gradually become a highly important field
in recent years. This paper proposes Open-vocabulary Re-

sponsible Visual Synthesis (4 ORES), to define the miss-
ing scenario in visual synthesis, aiming to promote further
research and enhance the responsible capabilities of various
synthesis models. Additionally, we present TIN, which is the
first work to apply LLM to responsible visual synthesis in
the open-vocabulary setting, demonstrating the potential of
LLMs in responsible visual synthesis. However, as CHAT-
GPT is closed-source, our framework relies on OpenAl’s
API, which increases response time and cost. In the future,
we will explore extending to open-source LLMs.
