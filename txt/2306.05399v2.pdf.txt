Abstract

In this paper, we propose the Matting Anything Model
(MAM), an efficient and versatile framework for estimat-
ing the alpha matte of any instance in an image with flex-
ible and interactive visual or linguistic user prompt guid-
ance. MAM offers several significant advantages over pre-
vious specialized image matting networks: (i) MAM is ca-
pable of dealing with various types of image matting, in-
cluding semantic, instance, and referring image matting
with only a single model; (ii) MAM leverages the feature
maps from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) [21] and
adopts a lightweight Mask-to-Matte (M2M) module to pre-
dict the alpha matte through iterative refinement, which has
only 2.7 million trainable parameters. (iii) By incorporat-
ing SAM, MAM simplifies the user intervention required for
the interactive use of image matting from the trimap to the

box, point, or text prompt. We evaluate the performance
of MAM on various image matting benchmarks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that MAM achieves com-
parable performance to the state-of-the-art specialized im-
age matting models under different metrics on each bench-
mark. Overall, MAM shows superior generalization ability
and can effectively handle various image matting tasks with
fewer parameters, making it a practical solution for unified
image matting. Our code and models are open-sourced at

1. Introduction

Image Matting, as a long-standing computer vision task,
aims to estimate the alpha matte a given an input image
J [45]. The matting target is mainly around human beings or
other objects at the semantic level [26,41,49]. Recent works

--- Page 2 ---
have extended the scope of image matting to more complex
scenarios like image instance matting [42], which requires
instance-aware alpha matte predictions and referring image
matting [28], which extracts the alpha matte given natural
language description.

Previous deep learning-based image matting meth-
ods [28, 29, 36, 37, 42, 47, 51,54, 59] have been proposed
to address specific image matting tasks on correspond-
ing benchmarks. These methods are tailored to individual
datasets and lack the flexibility to handle various image
matting tasks due to their fixed model designs. This lim-
itation has hindered the development of more generalized
and versatile image matting models. As a result, there is a
growing interest in developing more adaptive and efficient
image matting frameworks that can handle different types
of image matting tasks with a single model.

Furthermore, previous image matting methods have re-
lied on user-guided trimaps as auxiliary inputs to achieve
accurate alpha matte predictions. Although some trimap-
free methods have been proposed that use mask guidance
or background images instead [39,55], they are unable to
estimate the alpha matte of the target instance based on the
user request for interactive use. Therefore, it is crucial to
develop a model that can achieve accurate alpha matte es-
timation without relying on user-guided trimaps, while also
being capable of handling simple user requests in a flexi-
ble and efficient manner for interactive use. Such a model
would significantly enhance the user experience by reduc-
ing the extra need for manual intervention.

Motivated by these limitations of image matting, we pro-
pose the Matting Anything Model (MAM), a versatile net-
work that can estimate the alpha matte of any target in-
stance with prompt-based user guidance in an image as
shown in Figure 1. MAM leverages the recent Segment
Anything Model (SAM) framework [21], which supports
flexible prompting and outputs segmentation masks of any
target instance for interactive use. Specifically, MAM takes
the feature maps and mask outputs from SAM as inputs and
adds a lightweight Mask-to-Matte (M2M) module to predict
the alpha matte of the target instance. We trained MAM ona
combination of five image matting datasets that cover differ-
ent classes of instances, allowing the M2M module to learn
generalizable features for image matting. During training,
we randomly place target instances onto background im-
ages and use a pre-trained SAM to output mask predictions
of the corresponding instances. The trainable M2M mod-
ule then refines the mask by predicting multi-scale alpha
mattes. Through an iterative refinement process based on
the mask or the alpha matte, the multi-scale predictions are
merged to obtain the final meticulous alpha matte.

We conducted extensive evaluations of MAM on six im-
age matting benchmarks, including semantic image mat-
ting benchmark PPM-100 [40], AM2K [25] PM-10K [25],

the instance image matting benchmark RWP636 [55],
HIM2K [42], and the referring image matting benchmark
RefMatte-RW 100 [28]. Our results demonstrate that MAM
achieves performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art
image matting models across all benchmarks under differ-
ent evaluation metrics. The experimental results highlight
the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed approach
for handling various image matting tasks in an interactive
and efficient manner.

2.1. Image Matting

Given an image J, which can be view as a combination
of foreground image F' and background image B with co-
efficient alpha matte a,

I=aF+(1—a)B qd)

Image Matting is to estimate a given only J as inputs.
Traditional methods rely on a user-guided trimap, which
explicitly annotates the absolute foreground area, absolute
background area, and transition area. Then, sampling-based
image matting solutions use low-level features to distin-
guish the transition areas by measuring the similarities be-
tween foreground and background neighbors [1,2,5,8,9, 11].
Recently, deep learning-based methods [27, 36, 47, 51, 54,
59] adopt neural networks to estimate the alpha matte in an
end-to-end manner with trimap as auxiliary inputs. Some
trimap-free methods use background image [39], mask
guidance [32,55], or segmentation data [4, 30] to make up
the absence of trimap. When the image J contains multiple
instances, the composition turns to

a; represents the alpha matte of instance 7 and InstMatt [42]
adopt the target and reference mask as guidance to predic-
tion instance-aware alpha matte prediction. Interactive mat-
ting methods [28, 48, 52] develop specialized models that
use point, boxes, or text input to estimate the alpha matte of
the target instance. MatAny [53] is a concurrent work that
also adopts SAM for semantic image matting. In terms of
video matting, trimap-free [22—24, 30, 40] methods are ex-
plored for real-time inference while the per-frame predic-
tion quality is not comparable to image matting methods.
However, these methods are designed for a certain scenario
with corresponding benchmarks, which limits their poten-
tial to handle various image matting tasks and benchmarks
simultaneously.

matting, while it predicts the binary mask of different in-

input image J, SAM generates the mask prediction for the target instance based on the box or point user prompt. The M2M module takes

the concatenated inputs, including the image, mask, and feature maps, and produces multi-scale predictions Qoss, Qosa, and Qos1. The

stances in the image. Similar to image matting, many im-
age segmentation methods are tailored for a specific im-
age segmentation task, like semantic segmentation [3, 15],
instance segmentation [13, 46], and panoptic segmenta-
tion [20,44]. Recent works started to explore transformer-
based frameworks [6, 12, 16, 17] for unified image segmen-
tation. Language-guided segmentation frameworks [50,58]
look for text supervision to segment instance-aware masks.
OneFormer [16] adopts a single transformer model to learn
with a joint training strategy and performs universal seg-
mentation across semantic, instance and panoptic segmen-
tation and outperforms specialized models. SAM [21] takes
a further step recently, which supports flexible prompting
from users to segment any instance in an image for inter-
active use. Grounded-SAM [33] incorporates DINO with
SAM to add text prompt support. Foundation models like
SAM offer opportunities for other areas to develop versatile
frameworks to support a range of applications.

3. Matting Anything

In this section, we provide an overview of the Matting
Anything Model (MAM) architecture, which consists of
two main components: the frozen Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and the trainable Mask-to-Matte (M2M) module.
We first provide a brief review of the SAM, which is de-
signed to produce high-quality instance segmentation given
user-guided prompts. We then introduce the M2M mod-
ule, which enables the transformation of the binary masks
into high-quality alpha mattes. Finally, we describe how we
connect the M2M module with the SAM to gradually build

the end-to-end MAM.

3.1. Segment Anything Model

Segment Anything is a recently proposed foundation
model for segmentation. Given an image J € R°*#*W,
SAM uses a ViT-based image encoder to obtain deep feature
maps F € R©*is* 15, Then, a variety of N input prompts
are encoded by the prompt encoder and sent to the mask de-
coder with the feature maps. The mask decoder returns a
set of mask candidates m; € R'*4*™ | € N indicated by
the input prompts. With its flexible prompting mechanism,
SAM allows for interactive use and is easily adaptable for
downstream tasks.

3.2. Mask-to-Matte

The Mask-to-Matte (M2M) module is an integral com-
ponent of our Matting Anything Model (MAM) and is de-
signed to convert instance-aware mask predictions from
SAM into instance-aware alpha matte predictions efficiently
and smoothly. To achieve this, we utilize the feature maps
and mask predictions generated by SAM as auxiliary inputs
to M2M. To improve the accuracy of our predictions, we
adopt multi-scale branches for predicting the alpha matte
and merge these predictions through an iterative refinement
schedule.

maps F € R©*is* 16 and mask prediction m € R1X#xW

M2M employs several refinement blocks [7,55], which con-
tain connected self-attention layer [56], batchnorm layer,
and activation layer, to generate alpha matte predictions at
1/8 resolution, denoted as aos3 € R!* S*S. The feature
maps are then upsampled to higher resolutions to make al-
pha matte predictions at 1/4 and full resolution, denoted

The multi-scale predictions enable MAM to handle objects
of varying scales and provide finer-grained alpha mattes for
detailed object extraction.

Iterative Refinement To improve the accuracy of global
and local predictions, we use an iterative refinement pro-
cess. We first compute weight maps wosg, Wos4, and Wos1
that highlight different areas of the image during training
like trimaps. These weight maps are used to compute losses
for each scale of prediction, with w.sg emphasizing the en-
tire image for a sg predictions, wosa filtering out the back-
ground for as predictions, and wos1 focusing only on the
transition areas. During inference, we gradually merge the
predictions of Qosg, Qos4, and Qos; with the mask predic-
tions m from SAM to obtain the final alpha matte prediction

3.3. Matting Anything Model

After the development of the Mask-to-Matte (M2M)
module, we integrate it with the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) to enable end-to-end training and inference for the
Matting Anything Model (MAM). This integration allows
for a comprehensive and unified framework that handles
the entire matting process, from feature extraction to alpha
matte prediction.

Multi-Dataset Training To ensure the robustness and ver-
satility of our Matting Anything Model (MAM), we adopt
a multi-dataset training approach that encompasses diverse

foreground instances and background images from various
image matting datasets. This selection allows us to cover
a wide range of instance classes and background scenar-
ios, enhancing the model’s ability to handle different types
of instances and backgrounds effectively. During the train-
ing process, we create composite images by combining a
foreground instance F € R°*"*W with its correspond-
ing ground truth alpha matte a, € R!**W and a back-
ground image B € R°*“#*W_ The composition is per-
formed using the equation J = ag,F + (1 — agy)B. We
then extract the bounding box (2, yo, 71, y1) that encap-
sulates the instance of interest within the composite im-
age. Then, we send the image J and the bounding box as
a prompt to the pre-trained SAM, which returns the mask
prediction of the instance. Then, we concatenate the image,
mask and feature maps, and send them to the M2M mod-
ule, which further returns the multi-scale alpha matte pre-
dictions Qos, Qos4; Wos1- The loss £L is computed between
the multi-scale predictions and ground truth ag; as

L(Agt; Most; 084; Moss) = ALL +ACrapLLap (3)

£1 is L1 loss and £yap is Laplacian loss used in [14,30,43].
The coefficients \-, and \L,4p control the contribution of
each loss term, respectively. Both loss terms are computed
on multi-scale predictions as

Ly = Li (agt, 81) + £1 (Age, os) + Li(Qgt, oss) (4)

Lap = Ltap(Agt, %s1)+LLap(Agt, Vosa) +L Lap(Qgt, oss)
(5)
Multi-Benchmark Inference During the inference phase,
we conducted extensive evaluations of the Matting Any-
thing Model (MAM) on multiple image matting bench-
marks to assess its generality and adaptability. Given an
input image J, SAM produced the initial mask prediction

4. Experiments

We extensively evaluate the performance of MAM on
six diverse image matting benchmarks. Through compre-
hensive evaluations using different metrics, we compare
the performance of MAM with state-of-the-art image mat-
ting models on each benchmark. The results demonstrate
that MAM consistently achieves comparable performance
to specialized state-of-the-art models, reaffirming its versa-
tility and effectiveness as a unified image matting solution.

4.1. Implementation Details

Training Datasets During the training process, we ran-
domly select foreground instances from several image mat-

ting datasets, including Adobe Image Matting dataset [51],
Distinctions-646 [54], AM2K [25], Human-2K [34], and
RefMatte [28], to ensure a diverse range of instance classes.
For background images, we select them from two datasets:
COCO [31] and BG20K [25] to provide a mix of both real-
world and synthetic backgrounds.

Evaluation Benchmarks To evaluate the adaptive ability
of MAM, we test it on a variety of image matting bench-
marks including the semantic image matting benchmarks
PPM-100 [40], AM2K [25], PM-10K [25], the instance im-
age matting benchmark RWP636 [55], HIM2K [42], and the
referring image matting benchmark RefMatte-RW 100 [28].
The box prompt is used for all benchmarks and the point
prompt is only used in RefMatte-RW 100. This comprehen-
sive evaluation allows us to assess the generalization ca-
pability of MAM across various image matting tasks and
benchmarks.

Evaluation Metrics We evaluate the accuracy of predicted
alpha matte for MAM with commonly adopted evaluation
metrics. Specifically, we employ Mean Absolute Differ-
ence (MAD), Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD), Mean
Squared Error (MSE), Gradient (Grad), and Connectivity
(Conn) [38] as corresponding evaluation metrics. We scale
MAD, MSE, Grad, and Conn by 103, 103, 107%, and 10~%,
respectively. Lower values indicate better performance for
these metrics. Additionally, for instance-aware matting, we
utilize Instance Matting Quality (IMQ) [42], which takes
recognition and matting accuracy into consideration simul-
taneously. Higher values indicate better performance for the
IMQ metric.

Experimental Settings We trained MAM on a combina-
tion of training datasets using 8 RTX A6000 GPUs, with
a batch size of 10 images per GPU. Each image was a
combination of a randomly selected foreground instance
and a background image. Images were cropped to a size
of 1024 x 1024 and sent to a pre-trained ViT-B based
SAM [21] with a bounding box prompt of the target in-
stance. The feature maps and masks output by SAM were
then fed into the M2M module for alpha matte predic-

of Qosg, 3 refinement blocks for the prediction of a,s4, and

the total trainable parameters of MAM is 2.7 million param-
eters. We applied cosine learning rate decay with an initial
learning rate of 0.001 during training. During inference, we
used a single GPU with a batch size of 1. Each image was
resized to have its longer side at 1024 pixels and its shorter
side was padded to 1024 pixels before being sent to MAM
for alpha matte prediction of the target instance.

4.2. Main Results

Specialized vs Unified Model We present a high-level
comparison between specialized image matting models and
MAM on the semantic, instance, and referring image mat-
ting benchmarks in Table |. It shows that MAM has clear
improvements over SAM on all benchmarks. Furthermore,
MAM shows comparable performance to each specialized

image matting model and even reaches better performance
on the HIM2K, RWP635, and RefMatte-RW100, which
makes it a practical and feasible solution to unified image
matting.

Semantic Image Matting We evaluate the performance of
MAM on three semantic image matting benchmarks: PPM-
100 [40], AM2K [25], and PM-10K [25], as presented in
Table 3 and Table 2. The iterative refinement process is
based on the agsg prediction for all three benchmarks. On
the PPM-100 benchmark, MAM achieves improvements of
6.2 MSEqu and 3.9 MAD, over SAM. Similarly, on the
AM2K benchmark, MAM outperforms SAM with enhance-
ments of 7.64 SAD i, 4.4 MSE,y, 4.5 MAD,y, 41.54
Graday, and 7.59 SAD;,.;.

Instance Image Matting In Table 4 and Table 5, We eval-
uate MAM on two instance image matting benchmarks:
HIM2K [42] and RWP636 [55]. For HIM2K, the iterative
refinement is based on prediction mask m since it contains
multiple instances per image and starting from m removes
false positive predictions. Compared to other state-of-the-
art methods on HIM2K, MAM reaches comparable perfor-
mance with only 2.7 M extra trainable parameters, which

is only 10% of the specialized models like MGMatting and
InstMatt, which use the mask guidance from Mask RCNN.
On the RWP636 benchmark, we apply the iterative refine-
ment from a,;3 and MAM reaches the new state-of-the-art
with 54.40 IMQ naa and 76.45 IMQinse-

Referring Image Matting In Table 6, we present the eval-
uation of MAM on the RefMatte-RW100 benchmark [28],
a recently introduced referring image matting benchmark.
While previous methods rely on text prompts for refer-
ring image matting, we leverage the bounding boxes and
text descriptions as the prompts for SAM. Considering the
text prompt for SAM has not been released yet, we use
Grounded-SAM [33] to support text prompt guidance. Re-
markably, MAM achieves superior performance when uti-
lizing the bounding box as the prompt for SAM, surpassing
the text-based methods CLIPSeg and CLIPMat by a sig-
nificant margin. Moreover, the use of bounding boxes as
prompts offers user-friendly and intuitive interactions, as
users find it easier to provide bounding boxes compared to
composing a fixed text paragraph. This observation sug-
gests that the bounding box prompt is more effective for
interactive image matting than the text or point prompt for
referring image matting.

4.3. Ablation Study

We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the M2M
module of MAM, considering that SAM remains frozen
during the training process. To assess the performance
of MAM, we select the real-world subset of the HIM2K
benchmark.

SAM on HIM2K We begin by evaluating the pre-trained
ViT-B-based SAM using bounding boxes and points as
prompts for the target instance. SAM with box-based
prompts significantly outperforms the point-based prompts
and the final mask output is selected based on the mask
with the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) score with
the bounding box. SAM demonstrates strong performance
on the HIM2K benchmark, achieving 61.15 IMQ,naq and
74.01 IMQ,,,se on the natural subset.

Building MAM We then construct the M2M baseline by

ting and MAM. Improvements are highlighted in the red boxes.

integrating the M2M module, which takes SAM’s mask and
feature maps, as well as the image, as inputs. This base-
line, comprising 3 connected refinement blocks and pre-
dicting at 1/16 resolution, yields inferior performance com-
pared to SAM, as the low-resolution predictions lack fine
details of the alpha matte. However, by gradually incor-
porating multi-scale predictions and iterative refinement, as
described in Section 3.2, the performance of MAM im-
proves. Additionally, the adoption of multi-dataset training,
as outlined in Section 3.3, further enhances performance,
resulting in 68.37 IMQmaa and 81.56 IMQmse on the nat-
ural subset. Subsequently, we assess MAM’s performance
on other benchmarks without retraining to validate its gen-
erality and adaptability.

4.4. Visualization

In Figure 3, we compare matting performance between
MGMatting and MAM of images that contain multiple in-
stances. They both leverage mask guidance from SAM.
It shows that MAM is able to give more accurate alpha
matte predictions with only 10% parameters compared to
MGMatting under the same mask guidance. It also has
fewer false positive predictions in other instances. In Fig-
ure 4, we further provide visualizations of the mask and al-
pha matte predictions from SAM and MAM. These images
are selected from the semantic image matting benchmarks

and contain a single instance that can be a person, animal,
or transparent object. The visualizations demonstrate that
MAM achieves significantly improved predictions in the
transition areas without the trimap guidance, which high-
lights the superior performance of MAM in refining and en-
hancing the quality of alpha matte predictions.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce Matting Anything Model
(MAM), which uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM)

as a guidance module with a lightweight Mask-to-Matte
(M2M) module to refine the mask output into the alpha
matte of the target instance. M2M is designed to handle
various image matting tasks, including semantic, instance,
and referring image matting, using a single model based on
user prompts including points, boxes, and text. We evaluate
MAM on six image matting benchmarks and demonstrate
that it achieves comparable performance to the specialized
state-of-the-art methods under various evaluation metrics.
Our proposed model offers a more versatile and efficient
solution for interactive and unified image matting.
