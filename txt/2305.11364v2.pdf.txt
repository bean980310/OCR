ABSTRACT

Large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate smaller,
more refined datasets via few-shot prompting for benchmarking,
fine-tuning or other use cases. However, understanding and eval-
uating these datasets is difficult, and the failure modes of LLM-
generated data are still not well understood. Specifically, the data
can be repetitive in surprising ways, not only semantically but also
syntactically and lexically. We present LinguisticLens, a novel inter-
active visualization tool for making sense of and analyzing syntactic
diversity of LLM-generated datasets. LinguisticLens clusters text
along syntactic, lexical, and semantic axes. It supports hierarchical
visualization of a text dataset, allowing users to quickly scan for
an overview and inspect individual examples. The live demo is
available at https: //shorturl . at/ZHOUV.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large language models (LLMs) are becoming ubiquitous for their
ability to solve a wide range of linguistic tasks with prompting that
does not require additional model training [1,6,22]. This ability also
lets them generate smaller, more refined datasets for finetuning [13,
25,27], benchmarking [29], low-resource tasks or languages [4, 15],
and counterfactual testing (e.g., examples that are identical except
for having different religious or gender-based identities [12]).

A critical challenge lies in making sense of these generated
datasets and evaluating their quality. Given that the desired tasks are
often novel and have no existing dataset or ground truth by definition,
automatically evaluating the quality of these generated examples
with certain metrics is not straightforward. Although crowd workers
can evaluate the quality of individual examples, it is costly, and
finding patterns across large amounts of text examples remains a
challenge. Moreover, understanding the specific failure modes of
LLMs is still an evolving area, and these undesirable generated out-
put trends can be hard to spot. In particular, generated examples
often overfit to the seed examples in unexpected ways. One such
pathology is syntactic overfitting, where generated examples are
grammatically similarly or identical to the seed data. This can be
difficult to find as a single overfit example is not a problem, but if
larger portions of the dataset has the same syntactic structure, it is

--- Page 2 ---
a significant issue for dataset diversity. The same is true for lexical
overfitting, where specific words appear frequently in the generated
dataset more often than is desired.

In this paper, we present LinguisticLens, a novel interactive visual-
ization tool for making sense of synthetically-generated text datasets.
LinguisticLens specifically focuses on analyzing the syntactic and
lexical diversity of datasets. It allows users to explore groups of
examples that are clustered based on their syntactic structure and lex-
ical overlap. Clusters can be based on other text similarity methods
too, including embedding similarity, and we find that our approach
is more effective for analyzing the diversity of synthetic datasets.

LinguisticLens runs on web browsers and users simply need to
provide their datasets as CSV files. A live demo can be found at

2 BACKGROUND: SYNTHESIZING DATASETS USING LLMs

This section provides a brief background about how people generate
datasets using LLMs. Suppose we want to create a small dataset
of music recommendations to fine tune a music recommendation
model that returns a set of artists based on a short query provided
by a user. An example datapoint might have a query, ‘oldies but
goodies’, and a label ‘Aretha Franklin, The Beach Boys,
Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, Bill Withers.’

Within the prompt, we can provide a few examples that the model
can use to generate similar datapoints. This is known as few-shot, or
in-context, learning. For example, the prompt could be:

Query: {oldies but goodies}

Recommended Artists: {Aretha Franklin, Madonna}
Query: {music that makes you want to dance}
Recommended Artists: {Kraftwerk, The Cure, B-52s}
Query: {

The model will continue the text following this pattern (e.g., see
below), and from this we can parse a new set of examples. With this
approach, LLMs can create hundreds or thousands of these synthetic
examples. Our goal is to make sense of them.

3 RELATED WORK
3.1 Evaluating Datasets Generated by LLMs

Evaluating LLM-generated datasets is not a straightforward task.
In the best case, one can measure downstream performance of a
model trained on that data [4,25]. When this is impossible (e.g.,
benchmarks or a new task), the dataset quality must be evaluated
with defined metrics [13]. Automatic methods for evaluating LLM-
generated datasets include measuring the similarity between the
original distribution and generated distribution [25], but this is dif-
ficult for unstructured text, and presupposes that a golden corpus
exists, which would obviate the need for synthetic data in the first
place. Yuan et al. [29] use human evaluation to determine the quality
of individual examples. Lara et al. [19] measure diversity along
annotated features, such as topics and sentiment. Other methods in-
volve visualization-based human-in-the-loop qualitative evaluation.
In the image domain, Assogba et al. [2] built a visualization tool
with embedding-based clusters for comparing the distributions of
generated and ground truth images.

3.2 Visualizing Text Corpora

There is a large body of visualization research on making sense of
large text corpora [11,23,28]. Clustering, including topic modelings,
has been a popular approach to organizing text datasets [7, 9, 18].
Visualization is also a ubiquitous tool for machine learning inter-
pretability [8, 16,30], including those for text data [21,24, 26]. Reif
et al. [21] investigated how a pretrained BERT model internally
represents syntactic information through a range of visualizations.
However, visual analysis of text datasets synthesized from LLMs,
especially their syntactic structures, is underexplored [5, 10].

4 DESIGN CHALLENGES

We spoke to several software engineers and researchers at Google
who are using LLMs to synthesize data about the challenges they
had evaluating and understanding it. These use cases included mu-
sic queries, adversarial examples for fairness anal benchmarks,
medical questions, and to-do lists (with no personally identifiable
information), among others. Below we summarize our key findings.

Cl. Quick overview of datasets. Most of the practitioners we
spoke to first wanted to get a quick overview of the full dataset.
This included understanding what basic examples look like,
how much these examples tended to differ from each other,
and how much the examples matched the seed data.

C2. Identifying groups of examples and seeing their distribu-
tions. Practitioners also discussed trying to finding patterns,
specifically identifying groups of examples that share common
characteristics, and seeing their distributions. For example, in
the case of to-do lists, there were patterns in how long each of
the list items were, and how many items there were overall.

C3. Finding near duplicates. Examples are sometimes too sim-
ilar to each other: one of the most common challenges we
discussed was finding near duplicates. For example, many mu-
sic recommendation queries follow the form ‘ [BLANK] that
[BLANK] like [BLANK]’ (e.g., ‘music that sounds like na-
ture’). There are many almost identical examples where a
single word is swapped out. These are difficult to spot, e.g.,
when the words are mostly different, but the overall phrasing
is identical across a set of examples, when manually scanning
a long unordered list of data points. People found this a partic-
ularly thorny problem to address. Exact duplicates are usually
unequivocally bad and easy to find. However, what constituted
an undesirable near duplicate was not only dependent on use
cases, but also difficult to automatically detect.

C4. Understanding dataset diversity. Practitioners also wanted
to know whether or not the dataset was diverse. However, like
near duplication, the notion of diversity is hard to pin down
and differs depending on the use case: for the to-do lists, it
means having a broad range of words and topics in the lists;
for the music queries, it means having a range of different
phrasings, and having outliers that were far from the norm
but still relevant; and for the medical questions dataset, it is
important that the questions are phrased in different ways.

The overall consensus from the practitioners was that synthesiz-
ing data with LLMs was a novel task, without a robust evaluation
method or sensemaking tools to support it. Existing tools, like topic
modeling, could support some of the challenges (especially C1 and
C2), but focus on individual tokens, rather than longer sequences or
other structural properties of the text. Thus, we decided to design a
new tool that addresses the challenges that we identified.

5 VISUALIZATION DESIGN OF LINGUISTICLENS

We designed and developed LinguisticLens for exploring and evalu-
ating the linguistic diversity of synthesized text datasets. Linguisti-
cLens specifically focuses on finding patterns and fuzzy duplicates
across a set of examples. The details of our design are as follows.

5.1 Introducing LinguisticLens

Fig. 1 shows an interface of LinguisticLens, which uses Lit!, a
declarative web framework, and D3? for visualizing each example
as a graph structure. It consists of multiple columns (six in this
figure) each representing a cluster of examples. Each cluster lists
text examples vertically (e.g., about 12 examples in this figure).
Each text example (e.g., query text for a music recommender) is
represented as a sequence of tokens, shown as a colored rectangle.
We first describes how we visualize each example and then how we
cluster and visualize them for exploration and analysis.

5.2 Visualizing Individual Examples
As illustrated in Fig. 2, each example (e.g., a query) is visually
represented as a sequence of tokens, where each token is colored
based on its part-of-speech (POS) tag. The dependencies among the
tokens, extracted from the dependency parse graph is shown as arcs.
LinguisticLens displays multiple examples in a vertical column
and provides users with interactions to easily identify patterns across
the examples. See section Sect. 5.3 for how these are clustered
into columns. For instance, when a user hovers over a token in
an example, LinguisticLens highlights the hovered token and the
dependency link to that token, as well as tokens and links from other
examples with the same grammatical relationship (e.g., from NOUN to
ADP). Since these grammatical features are precalculated, it is trivial
to filter in this way. Fig. 3 shows an example when hovering over
the token ‘tool’. This enables users to quickly discover repeated
substructures of examples in the dataset.

5.3. Visualizing Clusters of Examples

To help users easily discover linguistic patterns (near duplicates (C3),
diversity (C4)) across groups of multiple examples (C2), we design

LinguisticLens to cluster examples by multiple different metrics
(e.g., POS, embedding, and token) and allow users to choose one.
These fuzzy duplicate clusters are shown in columns, with some
metadata about each cluster (e.g., count, frequent pattern).

5.3.1 Clustering with Syntax: Technical Details

Syntactic Feature Extraction. To represent each example with
its syntactic information, we extract a number of features. We first
represent each example in one of the three ways: as a sequence
of its individual tokens, as a sequence of the POS tags for those
tokens, and as a sequence of grammatical dependencies for those
tokens.? We then populate their n-grams (n = 1,2,3) from one
of these approaches. Then we define pair-wise similarity between
two examples by computing the n-gram overlaps and dividing by
the number of tokens in longer text. While embedding examples
using pretrained models is a well-known approach to representing
unstructured text datasets, the embedding encodes both semantic
and syntactic information. Thus, it is less effective for revealing
syntactic and lexical diversity of generated datasets.

Hierarchical Clustering. We run an agglomerative clustering
algorithm based on the similarity metrics defined from the extracted
features. From a dendrogram tree returned by the algorithm, we
form a list of flattened clusters for different numbers of clusters
(k = 3,5, 10,...,50). For each cluster, we maintain an ordered list
of examples where its order follows the order of the leaves in the
dendrogram tree, similar to the approach used in DendroMap [3].
This places similar examples next to each other, which can enable
users to easily identify groups of similar examples, especially near-
duplicates, when they are visualized.

5.3.2 Overview by Adapting Table Lens

LinguisticLens consists of multiple columns each representing one
of the clusters. An important challenge in visualizing text datasets is
that we cannot concurrently display many examples in screen, and
it would visually overwhelming even if we could. To effectively
provide an overview of large number of examples (C1), we adapt

Table Lens [20]. As shown in Fig. 4, LinguisticLens collapses
examples by default, but the user can expand them. It significantly
saves screen space while still presenting the grammatical patterns of
individual examples based on their POS tokens encoded by colors.
This enables users to quickly identify a range of linguistic patterns
and their distributions. For example, we see a cluster (top left) of
repetative examples that follow the pattern NOUN ADP DET NOUN.

5.3.3 Summary with Frequent Pattern Mining

To further help users quickly get a sense of the type of examples for
each cluster, we display the most frequent sequential pattern at the
top of each cluster. The pattern is formed as a sequence of items
where each item is either a text token or POS tag (e.g., (music, you,
can, VERB, to) as shown in the last one in Fig. 5), where VERB
is a POS tag, and the other four items are tokens. We additionally
display the number of occurrences of this pattern.

Algorithm Details. We extract the most frequent pattern by
adapting a well-known sequential pattern mining algorithm [14].
To form inputs to the pattern mining algorithm, we transform each
example into a sequence of token or its POS’s (e.g., (music| NOUN,
you|PRON, can| VERB, dance|VERB, to|ADP), allowing patterns
that are a mix of actual tokens and POS’s. Once several candidate
patterns are generated, we rank them to determine the most repre-
sentative. We score each pattern with a heuristic linear function
that incorporates a few signals, such as the number of occurrences
(higher score if appearing more), their length (higher score if pat-
tern has a larger number of tokens or POS’s), and proportion of
tokens/POS’s (higher score if actual tokens are used more than
POSes). For instance, a pattern (music, you, can, VERB, to)
can get a higher score than another pattern (music, PRON, can,
VERB), even if the latter appears more times, since the former is
longer contains more actual tokens. We return the highest scored
pattern as the most informative pattern that summarizes each cluster.

6 CASE STUDIES

We demonstrate LinguisticLens on two different use cases described
below. These were not run with domain experts, but do use real
data and were based on findings from our initial conversations. To
generate the datasets, we started with 5-10 hand-crafted examples,
expanding them to 500 examples using the method described in
Sect. 2 with PaLM 2 [1]. For data privacy reasons, we do not include
all the use cases from the motivating user conversations.

6.1 Dialog Agent
Our first use case is expanding a few dialogue examples into a
larger dataset for fine-tuning a LLM to be a dialogue model. Using
LinguisticLens, we quickly see what individual examples look like
(C1), and find some basic patterns (C2) from looking at clusters
with different metrics. E.g., we see that most examples are of similar
lengths (using the POS metric), that there is a variety of punctuation
types (embedding metric), and that there is a group of examples
asking for different kinds of favorites (token metric).

Undesirable Repetition (C3). We also see that there are repet-
itive examples in Fig. 6, for example, many instances of ‘<I/we>

amples, which should be deduplicated for a more diverse dataset.

Finding Outliers (C4). Due to the nature of agglomerative clus-
tering, the final cluster has outlier examples that are not similar
enough to other examples to be added to a different cluster. This
can be useful in two ways: sometimes these outliers are often either
degenerate, or so far from the desired distribution that they should
be deleted. However, they may also be beneficial, unique examples,
which the user can incorporate into the prompt iteration.

6.2 Music Recommendations

Our second use case utilizes the music dataset described in Sect. 2.
We explore an overview of examples in the dataset (C1) and look
for some patterns in example phrasing and content (C2).

Desirable Repetition. Interestingly, we found that Linguisti-
cLens was also useful for finding desirable repetition, and pointed
to areas of the dataset where more near-duplicates should be added.
For example, in the music dataset, there is a cluster of ‘best music
from the 90s’, ‘best music from the 70s’, etc. These
were actually deemed desirable: in fact, the user wanted to aug-
ment the dataset to include all decades. This points to the necessity
of human in the loop evaluation: there is no way to automatically
detect if duplication is good or bad in a given situation.

Undesirable Repetition (C3). As in the dialog case, we found
clusters of examples with near-duplicate grammar (Fig. 3 - left
column). These examples are individually interesting, but are syn-
tactically so similar to each other the user was worried a down-
stream mode would overfit to this pattern of ‘<nouns> that
sound like <nouns>’.

7 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WoRK

One area for future research is to design advanced human-in-the-loop
approaches for users to interactively identifying example clusters
based on metrics of interest. Another direction is to formalize the
notion of syntactic overfitting and use it as an evaluation metric for
different prompting strategies. A limitation of this work is scalability,
both in terms of individual example lengths as well as number of
examples. The current interface is optimized to examples that have
less than 10 tokens, while the lengths of input and output for LLMs
can be long.
