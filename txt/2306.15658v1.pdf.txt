Abstract

The recent work CLIPA [12] presents an inverse scal-
ing law for CLIP training — whereby the larger the im-
age/text encoders used, the shorter the sequence length of
image/text tokens that can be applied in training. This
finding enables us to train high-performance CLIP mod-
els with significantly reduced computations. Building upon
this work, we hereby present CLIPA-v2 with two key con-
tributions. Technically, we find this inverse scaling law is
also applicable in the finetuning stage, enabling further re-
duction in computational needs. Empirically, we explore
CLIPA at scale, extending the experiments up to the H/14
model with ~13B image-text pairs seen during training.

Our results are exciting — by only allocating a budget
of $10,000, our CLIP model achieves an impressive zero-
shot ImageNet accuracy of 81.1%, surpassing the prior best
CLIP model (from OpenCLIP, 80.1%) by 1.0% and mean-
while reducing the computational cost by ~39 x. Moreover,
with an additional investment of $4,000, we can further el-
evate the zero-shot ImageNet accuracy to 81.8%.

1. Introduction

CLIP [17] has emerged as the pioneering foundation
model that bridges the gap between text and images, usher-
ing computer vision research into the “post-ImageNet” era
[10, 13, 27, 1, 18, 20, 22, 25, 4]. However, the demanding
computational requirements of CLIP hinder its widespread
exploration. The recent work CLIPA [12] offers a compu-
tationally efficient solution — with the introduction of an
inverse scaling law for CLIP training, it reveals that larger
models can be trained with fewer input tokens. Building
upon this observation, CLIPA demonstrates its efficacy in
scenarios with limited computational resources, leading to
a substantial reduction in the training cost of CLIP.

This report provides a follow-up on CLIPA. Firstly, we
validate that the inverse scaling law is also applicable when
finetuning models with input tokens at full resolution. This
further reduces the training cost of CLIPA. Secondly, we
investigate the performance of CLIPA at scale across vari-
ous aspects, including model size (up to H/14), data (up to
DataComp-1B [6] and LAION-2B [22] datasets), and train-
ing schedule (up to ~13B samples seen).

Table 1: Scaling up CLIPA-v1 [12]. Specifically, we explore scaling from the aspects of data, model, and schedule. We
pretrain the H/14 model with 36 image tokens (84 x 84) and 8 text tokens; for finetuning, we use 256 (224 x 224) image

tokens and 32 text tokens, following [12].

With these two contributions, we can train CLIP models
with strong zero-shot performance on ImageNet [5], mean-
while significantly reducing training costs. For instance,
we can train a H/14 model with 81.1% accuracy within a
$10,000 budget. We stress that, compared to the best pub-
licly available CLIP model from OpenCLIP [10], ours is
both better (+1.0%) and faster (by ~39x). Moreover, we
can further boost this accuracy to 81.8%, with an additional
$4,000 investment. These results are exciting as no prior
work has thus far reached a similar performance within this
small budget limitation. By open-sourcing our training code
and models, we hope to contribute to the broader advance-
ment and adoption of advanced CLIP models.

2. Background

CLIP has been a prominent foundation model due to its
exceptional zero-shot capability and remarkable versatility
[17, 11]. The tremendous success of CLIP can be attributed
to the extensive scale of both the data [17, 21, 11, 3, 27, 28]
and the model [26, 15, 23] it is built upon. Nevertheless, it
also poses a significant cost barrier to researchers who wish
to train a strong CLIP model. To reduce the computational
burden, the recent work by Li et al. [12] presents an inverse
scaling law, which reveals that larger models can effectively
utilize fewer input tokens for training without severe perfor-
mance drop, therefore enabling highly efficient CLIP train-
ing. As a byproduct of this discovery, the CLIPA models
are introduced, which attain a zero-shot top-1 ImageNet ac-
curacy of 69.3% and can be trained on an 8 A100-GPU ma-
chine in just 4 days.

Our work is built upon CLIPA [12], but focuses on fur-
thering its efficiency and scaling it up.

3. Experiments

Our experiments contain three parts. Firstly, we check
the applicability of inverse scaling law during the finetuning
stage with full-resolution tokens. Next, we scale up CLIPA
in terms of data, model, and schedule. Lastly, we compare
with other advanced CLIP models in terms of performance
and computation cost. Our pretraining setup strictly follows
CLIPA [12]. We report the corresponding zero-shot top-1
accuracy on ImageNet [5].

Inverse scaling law in the finetuning stage. Follow-
ing [12], we choose four different scales of models: S/16,

B/16, L/16, and H/14, and train them on LAION-400M
dataset. Random masking [13, 7] is used as the image to-
ken reduction strategy. As shown in Figure 2, larger models
consistently exhibit a lower performance drop compared to
smaller models when finetuning with the same number of
input tokens. For instance, retaining 50% of the input to-
kens merely results in a performance drop of 0.4% for the
H/14 model, compared to much higher drops of 0.8% for
L/16, 1.1% for B/16, and 1.8% for S/16.

These results confirm the existence of the inverse scaling
law in the finetuning stage, which enables us to reduce the
required computations for CLIP training further.

Scaling up CLIPA [12]. We next investigate the scaling
behavior beyond the largest case studied in CLIPA. Specif-
ically, our scaling efforts cover three aspects: model, data,
and training schedule. The results are reported in Table 1.
First, we can observe that scaling the model size from
L/14 to H/14 boosts the performance from 69.3% to 72.8%.
Furthermore, we note switching the training dataset from
LAION-400M [22] to LAION-2B [21] yields another 1.3%
improvement, suggesting the importance of data diversity.
Lastly, by increasing the training schedule by a factor of
5, resulting in a total of ~13B seen samples, we achieve
an impressive performance of 77.9%. We stress that this

scaled version of CLIPA H/14 model readily outperforms
its counterpart in FLIP [13] by 0.3% while requiring only
1/3 of the training budget.

These results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of
training CLIPA at scale. Next, we set this CLIPA H/14 with
77.9% performance as our baseline for further ablation in
the finetuning stage.

Ablation. In addition to random masking, we hereby in-
vestigate how grid masking and block masking affect fine-
tuning performance. The results are reported in Table 2. In-
terestingly, compared to finetuning input tokens at the full
resolution, we observe that 25% masked random finetun-
ing and block finetuning all lead to a slight performance
improvement. With a larger masking ratio, all these mask-
ing strategies will lead to worse performance than full-
resolution fine-tuning; but overall, random masking consis-
tently yields stronger performance than the other two mask-
ing strategies.

We next ablate different finetuning setups and summa-
rize the results in Table 3. We choose 30% masked ran-
dom finetuning as the default strategy, as it leads to a slight
performance improvement (+0.1%) and enables a 1.3x
speedup of the finetuning process. Furthermore, adopting
a 4x finetuning schedule results in an additional improve-
ment of 0.6%. However, further increasing the finetuning
schedule does not lead to any substantial performance gains.

Following [10], we also investigate progressively fine-
tuning with large image resolutions. Initially, for the first
512 million samples, we finetune the model using a 224 x
224 input size with a masking ratio of 30%; subsequently,
for the remaining 128 million samples, we adopt a larger

336 x 336 input size with a masking ratio of 40% and a
smaller learning rate. As shown in the last row of Table 3,
i.e., case (5), progressive finetuning results in a slight per-
formance improvement of 0.2% compared to direct finetun-
ing with a 336 x 336 input size and meanwhile achieving a
notable 1.5x speedup of the finetuning process.
Comparison with OpenCLIP [10]. We summarize the re-
sults in Table 4. Firstly, when trained on the LAION-
2B dataset, our CLIPA-v2 H/14 model outperforms Open-
CLIP’s version by 1.1% (79.1% vs. 78.0%) and meanwhile
significantly reducing the training cost by ~18x.  Fur-
thermore, when upgrading to the DataComp-1B dataset,
our CLIPA-v2 H/14 (pretrained on images at 70 x 70)
achieves an impressive zero-shot ImageNet accuracy of
81.1%, while keeping the training cost within $10,000. No-
tably, this 81.1% accuracy is 1.0% higher than the prior best
CLIP model, which is OpenCLIP’s G/14 model with a zero-
shot ImageNet accuracy of 80.1%.

With an additional investment of $4000, we can further
enhance CLIPA-v2’s training by 1) pretraining with a larger
resolution (the image size from 70 to 84) and 2) applying
the progressive finetuning with a larger image resolution of
336. These enhancements lead to an additional 0.7% im-
provement, resulting in the best-performing CLIP model to
date with an 81.8% zero-shot ImageNet accuracy.

laion.ai/blog/large-openclip/ and https://laion.ai/
blog/giant-openclip/.

google.com/compute/gpus~pricing, which is $1.575 per GPU

hour, and https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud/
pricing, which is $1.5 per GPU hour.

We also validate the superiority of CLIPA-v2 models
on zero-shot robustness. For example, our 81.8% H/14
model consistently yields much stronger performance than
OpenCLIP’s 80.1% G/14 model on IN-V2 [19] (75.6% vs.
73.6%), IN-A [9] (82.7% vs. 69.4%), IN-R [8] (94.4% vs.
92.2%), ObjectNet [2] (77.4% vs. 73.0%), and IN-SK [24]
(72.8% vs. 68.9%). However, we note that, when evalu-
ating zero-shot retrieval performance on COCO [14] and
Flickr30k [16], OpenCLIP’s 80.1% G/14 model still per-
forms the best. We conjecture this performance advantage
should be attributed to the difference in training datasets,
as Table 4’s results empirically suggest models trained with
LAION-2B are better at retrieval tasks than models trained
with DataComp-1B.

We have open-sourced these advanced CLIP models in
both JAX and PyTorch to facilitate future research.
