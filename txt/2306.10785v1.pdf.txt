ABSTRACT

Multitrack music transcription aims to transcribe a music audio
input into the musical notes of multiple instruments simultaneously.
It is a very challenging task that typically requires a more complex
model to achieve satisfactory result. In addition, prior works mostly
focus on transcriptions of regular instruments, however, neglecting
vocals, which are usually the most important signal source if present
in a piece of music. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neu-
ral network architecture, Perceiver TF, to model the time-frequency
representation of audio input for multitrack transcription. Perceiver
TF augments the Perceiver architecture by introducing a hierarchical
expansion with an additional Transformer layer to model temporal
coherence. Accordingly, our model inherits the benefits of Perceiver
that posses better scalability, allowing it to well handle transcrip-
tions of many instruments in a single model. In experiments, we
train a Perceiver TF to model 12 instrument classes as well as vo-
cal in a multi-task learning manner. Our result demonstrates that the
proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts (e.g.,
MT3 and SpecTNT) on various public datasets.

1. INTRODUCTION

Automatic music transcription (AMT) is a Music Information Re-
trieval (MIR) task that aims to transcribe a music audio input into a
sequence of musical notes where each note contains attributes of on-
set, pitch, duration, and velocity. The output is typically delivered in
the format of MIDI. In a multitrack setting, an AMT system should
identify every instrument that is present in the input, and estimate the
associated notes accordingly into a channel of the MIDI output. Ide-
ally speaking, using the identified instrument for each corresponding
channel, the synthesized audio mixture from the output MIDI should
resemble the original input audio in a musically plausible way.
Although recent years have seen significant progress using deep
learning techniques , our analysis and review indicate that two
major challenges have not yet been addressed effectively: model
scalability and instrument discrimination. Multitrack AMT is gener-
ally regarded as a very challenging task. The number of commonly
used instruments can be up to 100. Among them, musical notes of
regular instruments like guitar, violin, and synthesizers are difficult
to characterize due to their tremendous variations in timbre, expres-
sivity, and playing techniques. Other than that, vocals, which usually
are the most predominant instrument if present, vary their timbre and
pitch to convey lyrics and expressions. To handle all instruments
multaneously, it requires better model scalability. Our observations
on existing multitack AMT systems reveal that they oftentimes re-
sult in many false positive notes for popular pitched instruments like

piano and guitar. For instance, notes of string ensemble are mas-
sively captured by piano. This might be because the system does not
provide clear timbre-dependent features or it is not robust to timbral
variations across different instruments. We believe this problem can
be mitigated if the system can discriminate each instrument source
from the mixture while making inference.

To address model scalability, we propose Perceiver TF, which
is an augmented variant of the Perceiver [3]. Perceiver has been
well-known for its better scalability in the Transformer family to
tackle high-dimensional data input. In this work, we adopt spec-
trogram for audio input, with T and F' representing the lengths of
the time- and frequency-axes, respectively. For multitrack AMT, ca-
pability to model the timbre-dependent pitches of multiple instru-
ments is crucial, so more comprehensive operations are needed to
capture useful features along the high-resolution frequency axis. Re-
cently, the SpecTNT architecture [4] was proposed for this purpose
and achieved state-of-the-art performance in vocal melody extrac-
tion (a sub-task of AMT). SpecTNT consists of two Transformers
in a hierarchical structure, where the lower-level Transformer per-
forms self-attention directly on the spectrum of a frame. However,
such design leads to a cubic complexity of attention computation,
ie, O(TF? + T?), limiting its expandability for more complex
tasks. To this end, we conceive a non-trivial combination of Per-
ceiver and SpecTNT: expanding Perceiver to be hierarchical. The
resulting Perceiver TF takes advantage of the cross-attention to ex-
tre ectral features into a latent bottleneck for each frame, and
adds an additional Transformer for self-attention along the time axis,
overall resulting in a quadratic complexity of O(TF + T°). Since F
is typically large, this complexity reduction is significant, allowing
the model to handle more instruments simultaneously.

To address instrument discrimination, we adopt the random-
mixing augmentation technique learned from music source separa-
tion (MSS) {5]|6, which aims to separate each instrument stem from
the input audio mixture [7]. Moreover, we train our AMT model in
a multi-task learning fashion, with each sub-task modeling the tran-
scription of an instrument. This multi-task design along with the
random-mixing technique allows more flexibility to train with enor-
mous amount of augmented training samples. Our strategy differs
from previous works that jointly train the AMT task with instrument
recognition [8] or MSS to help inform the model of instrument-
dependent features. To our knowledge, little work has been done
using random-mixing technique to improve multitrack AMT.

2. RELATED WORK

prove transcription on low-resource datasets [I] [12]. These prior
examples demonstrated that models based on the pianoroll repre-
sentation are able to capture instrument-dependent onset, pitch, and
duration of notes. Different from the pianoroll approach, Gardner et
al. created a new paradigm that proposes a sequence-to-sequence
model, called MT3, to tackle multitrack AMT. They trained a stan-
dard encoder-decoder Transformer to model multitrack MIDI tokens
from audio, and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on sev-
eral public datasets.

By contrast, vocal transcription is usually treated as an indepen-
dent task in the literature, even though it shares the same goal of
AMT. Due to the lack of training data, few works focused on tran-
scribing note-level outputs from polyphonic music audio. Recently,
Wang et al. released a human annotated dataset including 500 Chi-
nese songs They provide a CNN based model (EFN) for a
baseline of the task. In [14], a teacher-student training scheme is
proposed to utilize pseudo labels derived from FO estimations of vo-
cal. Lately, proposed a vocal transcription system that requires
an MSS as front-end. In this work, we propose a unified framework
that combines vocal and multi-instrument transcriptions, and it does
not rely on pre-trained modules such as an MSS front-end.

3. METHODOLOGY

In this work, we adopt the pianoroll approach instead of the
sequence-to-sequence (seq-to-seq) approach for two major rea-
sons. First, it is easier to manipulate the loss computation to learn
from partially labeled data. For example, it is non-trivial to train a
seq-to-seq model that joints a vocal transcription dataset where the
MIDI ground truth of accompaniments is not available. Second, the
inference time complexity of seq-to-seq depends on the number of
notes (tokens) due to the auto-regressive nature. If the audio input
contains many instruments with complex, dense polyphonic notes,
the inference will be very slow. Although our proposed model is

also a Transformer-oriented architecture, we focus on the encoder
part to predict the pianoroll directly.

The following sections explain the proposed model architecture
(Sections 3.1 — 3.3) and the random-mixing augmentation technique
(Section 3.4). Our model consists of three sub-modules: convolu-
tional module, Perceiver TF module, and output module. The input
spectrogram is first passed through the convolution module for local
feature aggregation. Then, the perceiver TF module, which includes
multiple Perceiver TF blocks, extracts the features and outputs the
temporal embeddings at each time step. Lastly, the output module
projects the temporal embeddings into desired dimensions for pi-
anoroll outputs.

3.1. Convolutional Module

Using convolutional neural network (CNN) as the front-end of
Transformer-based models has became a common design choice
in speech recognition pipeline [16]. Previous works have also
found that the CNN front-end plays an crucial role in SpecTNT
and MIRTransformer for many MIR tasks
lowing this practice, we stack multiple residual uni
average pooling to reduce the dimensionality of the frequency
axis. We denote the resulting time-frequency representation as
S = [S0,$1,...,Sr—1] € RT*XFXC where T, F, and C represent
the dimensions of time, frequency, and channel, respectively.

3.2. Perceiver TF Module

A conventional Perceiver architecture contains two major compo-
nents (i) a cross-attention module that maps the input data and a
latent array into a latent array; (ii) a Transformer tower that maps a
latent array into a latent array. Upon this structure, our design prin-
ciple to expand Perceiver is twofold. (1) We consider the spectra
representation of a time step, Sz, is pivotal to carry the pitch and tim-
bral information, so it serves as the input data for the cross-attention
module to project the spectral information into a latent array for the
time step t. Each latent array is responsible for extracting the loca
spectral features. (2) Having a sequence of latent arrays of differ-
ent time steps, we need a Transformer to exchange the local spectra
information along the time axis to learn their temporal coherence.

The Perceiver TF architecture is illustrated in Fig. i} A Perceiver
TF block contains three Transformer-style modules: spectral cross-
attention, latent Transformer, and temporal Transformer, which are
responsible for modeling the spectral, channel-wise, and tempora
information, respectively. Each of them includes the attention mech-
anism and a position-wise feed-forward network.

The spectral cross-attention (SCA) module operates directly
on an input spectral representation S; and projects it into the Key
(K) and Value (V) matrices. Unlike the traditional Transformer,
the cross-attention module in Perceiver maps a latent array into
the Query (Q) matrix and then performs the QKV self-attention
accordingly. We follow the Perceiver design to initialize a set of
EK learnable latent arrays ©° © R**?, where K is the index di-
mension, and D is the channel dimension. Then, we repeat ©° for
T times and associate each to a time step t, which is then denoted
as OP, such that 03 = Of = ...O%_,, meaning that all latent
arrays are from the same initialization across the time axis. This er
plays an important role of carrying the spectral information from the
first Perceiver TF block throughout the entire stack of blocks. The
query-key-value (QV) attention of our SCA of the h-th iteration
can be written as: fsca : {0!, Se} > Of", and this process will
be repeated as the Perceiver TF block repeats in order to maintain


--- Page 3 ---
the connection between ©! and the input S;. The design of the
cross-attention module is the key that significantly improves the
computational scalability of Perceiver. For instance, our SCA re-
sults in O(F'K), which is much cheaper than O(F”) of the spectral
Transformer in SpecTNT [4], given that A (dimension of the latent
array) is typically small (ie., K < F).

The latent Transformer module takes place after the SCA mod-
ule. It contains a stack of N Transformers to perform standard
self-attention on the latent arrays of o}. The resulting complex-
ity O(N K”) is efficient as well. In the context of AMT, this process
means the interactions among the onsets, pitches, and instruments
are explicitly modeled. To perform multitrack AMT, we initialize
K latent arrays and train each latent array to handle one specific
task. Following , for an instrument, we arrange two latent arrays
to model the onset and frame-wise (pitch) activations, respectively.
This leads to K = 2J, where J is the number of target instruments.

The temporal Transformer module is placed to enable the com-
munication between any pairs of ©! of different time steps. To
make the temporal Transformer understand the time positions of
each latent array, we add a trainable positional embedding to each
e? during the initialization. Let Or (k), k=0,..., K-1, denote
each latent array in ©, we arrange K parallel standard Transform-
ers in which each serves the corresponding input sequence of latent
arrays: [62 (k), 0 (k),...,0_4(k)]. The module is repeated M
times, yielding a complexity of O(MT7).

Finally, we repeat L times the Perceiver TF block to form the
overall module. Note that, different from the original Perceiver, the
weights of spectral cross-attention and latent Transformer are not
shared across the repeated blocks.

3.3. Output Module

We utilize two GRU modules with sigmoid activation function
for the onset and frame-wise latent array outputs, respectively. We
follow prior work that uses the onset outputs to condition the
frame-wise activation.

3.4. Multi-task Training Loss

We formulate the loss function for training the proposed model:

Jal

£= Wer + Bane) a)

j=0

where | is the binary cross-entropy loss between the ground-truth and
prediction, /%..., and /7.,,,,. are respectively the onset and frame acti-
vation losses for instrument j. Note that the losses for all J instru-
ments should be computed, regardless of whether the corresponding
instruments are active or not in a training sample. Therefore, a zero
output is expected for instruments that are not present in the sample.

4.1. Datasets

We use four public datasets for evaluation. Slakh2100 contains
2100 pieces of multitrack MIDI and the corresponding synthesized
audio. The MIDI files are a subset of Lakh dataset [24], and the
audio samples were synthesized by professional-grade software. In-
struments were grouped into 12 MIDI classes defined in the Slakh
dataset] We used the official train/validation/test splits in our exper-

! There is no Sound Effects”, ’Percussive” and ”Ethnic” instruments. We
grouped ”’Strings” and Ensemble” into one instrument class.

iments. MAESTROv3 contains about 200 hours of piano solo
recordings with the aligned note annotations acquired by the MIDI
capturing device on piano. We follow the official train/validation/test
splits. GuitarSet contains 360 high-quality guitar recordings
and their synchronized note annotations. Since there is no official
splits for this dataset, we follow the setting in [2]. The first two pro-
ions of each style are used for training, and the last one is for
testing. MIR-ST500 [13] contains 500 Chinese-pop songs with note
annotations for the lead vocal melody. We used the official train-test
split. Although around 10% of the training set is missing due to fail-
ure links, we ensure the testing set is complete for fair comparison.

4.2. Data Augmentations

Annotating data for multitrack AMT is labor intensive. To better ex-
ploit the data at hand, we apply two data augmentation techniques
during training. Following previous works [4] [27], pitch-shifting
is randomly performed to all the non-percussive instruments dur-
ing training. We introduce the cross-dataset random-mixing (RM)
technique. Let us first define three types of datasets:

* Multi-track: each sample contains multi-tracks of instrument-
wise audio stems with polyphonic notes (e.g., Slakh), and no
vocal signals are present.

* Single-track: each sample contains only a single non-vocal stem
with polyphonic notes (e.g., MAESTRO and GuitarSet).

* Vocal-mixture: each sample is a full mixture of music with mono-
phonic notes only for lead vocal (e.g., MIR-ST500). We employ
a MSS tool to separate each sample into vocal and accompa-
niment stems.

Each training sample is excerpted from a random moment of its orig-
inal song with a duration depending on the model input length (e.g.,
6 seconds). Suppose we want to transcribe J classes of instruments,
and the corresponding instrument set is denoted as Q = {w,}/ =.
Then, we apply three treatments to the three mentioned types of
datasets respectively as follows.

First, for a training sample s; from a multi-track dataset, we
denote its instrumentation template as wi C QQ, indicating the in-
struments present in s;. Then, for each instrument w; in pi, it has
a p% chance to be replaced by aw; in fru, where i # u (ie., a dif-
ferent sample). Second, for a sample s; from a single-track dataset,
we randomly pick an existing instrumentation template jr. (i # wu)
as its background. If the instrument of s; is present in jz,,, that stem
will be removed from j,,. For instance, if s; is a piano solo, then we
will remove the piano stem from jz. From our preliminary experi-
ment, presenting the solo example to model training without mixing
it with a background can degrade the performance. Lastly, for a sam-
ple s; from a vocal-mixture dataset, it has a g% chance to replace its
background by two methods: (i) like the single-track treatment, we
randomly pick an existing p42. (i 4 u) as its background; or (ii) we
randomly pick an accompaniment stem separated from s,, where
i # v. For the second method, since the selected accompaniment
stem does not have the ground-truth notes, we mask the instrument
outputs and only count the loss for the vocal output (see Eq. [Ip.

4.3. Implementation Details

We implemented our system using PyTorch [29]. The audio wave-
form is re-sampled to 16kHz sampling rate. We set the model input
length to be 6 seconds. The log-magnitude spectrogram is then com-
puted using 2048 samples of Hann window and a hop size of 320
samples (i.e., 20 ms). The convolutional module contains 3 residual

blocks, each of them has 128 channels and is followed by an average
pooling layer with a time-frequency filter of (1, 2).

For the Perceiver TF module, we use the following parameters
(referring to Fig. [I): (i) depending on different experiment configu-
rations, initialize 2.J latent arrays, each uses a dimension of 128; (ii)
stack LZ = 3 Perceiver TF blocks; (iii) for each Perceiver TF block,
use | spectral cross-attention layer, N = 2 latent Transformer lay-
ers, and MZ = 2 temporal Transformer layers. All the Transformer
layers has an hidden size of 128 with 8 heads for the multi-head at-
tention. Finally, the output module is a 2-layer Bi-directional GRU
with 128 hidden units. All of the Transformer module in the Per-
ceiver TF include dropout with a rate of 0.15. The output dimension
for onset and frame activations are 128 and 129, respectively, where
128 corresponds to the MIDI pitches, and the additional 1 dimension
in the frame activation is for the silence. We use AdamW s
learning optimizer. The initial learning rate and weight decay rate
are set to 10~° and 5 x 107%, respectively.

For final output, we take a threshold of 0.25 for both the onset
and frame probability outputs to get the binary representations, so
the frame-wise activations can be merged to generate each note in a
piano-roll representation. No further post-processing is applied.

For data augmentation, all of the non-percussive instruments of
a training example have a 100% probability to be pith-shift up or
down by at most 3 semi-tones. For random-mixing, we use p = 257
and g = 50% for data from multi-track and vocal-mixture datasets,
respectively. To generate an input sample, all the instrument stems
in each training example are linearly summed up.

4.4. Baselines

Two state-of-the-art models, MT3 [2] and SpecTNT [4], are selected
as the baselines. For MT3, we replicated the model following

on the test set. For SpecTNT, we adopted the configuration used
for vocal melody extraction reported in In the preliminary ex-
periments, we found it non-trivial to successfully train the original
SpecTNT on Slakh2100 under the multi-instrument setting, so we
skip this experiment. For vocal transcription, the best results of EFN
[13] and JDC;ote(L+U) [14] are reported.

4.5. Evaluation Metrics

We use “Onset F1” score, which indicates the correctness of both
pitches and onset timestamps, as the evaluation metric for compar-
ison with previous work To further evaluate the performance
of multi-instrument transcription, we report the ’Multi-instrument
Onset F1” score for the Slakh dataset. The outputs from our repli-
cated MT3 model are grouped into 12 instrument cla ased on
their program numbers. The Multi-instrument Onset F1 score we
used only counts Onset Fl, which is similar to the MV2H metric
. It could be slightly different from the one used in 2], since the
“Drums” outputs do not contain clear offset information.

4.6. Result and Discussion

Table [I] shows the comparison in terms of Onset Fl between the
proposed model and baselines. The proposed model and SpecTNT
which directly model the spectral inputs with the attention mecha-
nism shows higher performance for cases even trained on low re-
sources of a single dataset, such as GuitarSet. On MIR-ST500, the
proposed model significantly outperforms the baselines. Although
SpecTNT (Single) performs slightly better than our model on MAE-
STRO, we still consider Perceiver TF to be more advantageous to
practical use for its better inference efficiency.

Table 2] presents the Multi-instrument Onset F1 (instrument-
weighted average) and the Onset F1 scores of individual instrument
classes on Slakh2100 to reveal instrument-wise performance. Com-
pared to MT3", our model without the random-mixing augmentation
(No-RM) performs significantly better on less-common instruments
such as “Pipe” (the Onset Fl score is upper by over 100%). Apply-
ing random-mixing in training can further boost the performance in
all cases, indicating the technique indeed improves the model ro-
bustness to discriminate between different instruments. Finally, we
observe that combining multi-instrument and vocal transcriptions
can improve the vocal transcription alone, as the combined model is
trained with more randomly mixed vocal-accompaniment samples.

5. CONCLUSION

We have presented Perceiver TF, a novel architecture that adequately
addresses the model scalability problem for multitrack AMT. To
address the instrument discrimination issue, we have proposed the
random-mixing augmentation technique, which significantly facili-
tates the data usability across datasets. Our system has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance on different public datasets. We believe
Perceiver TF is generic and can be applied to other analogous tasks.
