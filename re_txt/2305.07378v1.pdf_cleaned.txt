--- --arX1v:2305.07378v1 [cs.CL] 12 MaySurfacing Biases in Large Language Models using Contrastive Input Decoding Gal Yona* Weizmann Institute Or Honovich Tel Aviv University Abstract Ensuring that large language models (LMs) are fair, robust and useful requires an understanding of how different modifications to their inputs impact the model’s behaviour. In the context of open-text generation tasks, however, such an evaluation is not trivial. For example, when introducing a model with an input text and a perturbed, “contrastive” version of it, meaningful differences in the next-token predictions may not be revealed with standard decoding strategies. With this motivation in mind, we propose Contrastive Input Decoding (CID): a decoding algorithm to generate text given two inputs, where the generated text is likely given one input but unlikely given the other. In this way, the contrastive generations can highlight potentially subtle differences in how the LM output differs for the two inputs in a simple and interpretable manner. We use CID to highlight context-specific biases that are hard to detect with standard decoding strategies and quantify the effect of different input perturbations. 1 Introduction Large pre-trained language models (LMs) have revolutionized natural language processing in recent years (Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020). However, their practical applicability remains hindered by their extreme sensitivity to minor input perturbations (natural and adversarial), including ones that humans deem insignificant (Belinkov and Bisk, 2017; Sun et al., 2018). Consider using an LM to answer medical questions, such as “What happens if listeria is left untreated?”, as in the HealthSearchQA dataset (Singhal et al., 2022). What is the effect of specifying demographic information (e.g. “left untreated in men?” vs “left untreated in women?”)? In classification tasks (e.g. select one option from a list), $al. yona@gmail.com; Work completed during an internship at Google. Roee Aharoni Google Itay Laish Google we could directly evaluate whether the model’s prediction is changed. But in open-text generation tasks, it is not directly clear how to test the impact of the perturbation, as the relevant outcome space is now huge.! We could determinsically generate several likely responses given both inputs (e.g. using greedy decoding or beam search) and compare them, but this may only scratch the surface: meaningful differences in model behaviour may not be revealed with this comparison, which only looks at a small set of highly probable sequences. Such differences, while subtle, are important to understand and quantify (for example, a malicious user may attempt to amplify them to trigger a problematic behaviour even with greedy decoding methods). Alternatively, we could stochastically generate likely responses given each input (e.g. using temperature sampling), but then it is less clear how to compare the outputs we obtained with each input. Beyond the issues of fairness and robustness, it was shown that success on many well-defined tasks is highly sensitive to small changes in phrasing (Srivastava et al., 2022; Efrat et al., 2022), especially now that “prompt-engineering” became a standard practice. Given that, understanding the impact of input/prompt modifications is highly important. In this work, we take a step towards addressing these challenges by introducing a new decoding strategy: Contrastive Input Decoding (CID). Our decoding algorithm accepts two inputs: a regular input x and a “contrastive” input 2’, with the objective of generating sequences that are likely given x but unlikely given x’. These contrastive generations highlight the differences in how the model treats these two inputs in an interpretable manner. CID is parameterized by a hyper-parameter \ € R that controls the degree of contrasting (A = 0 recovers standard, non-contrastive, decoding). In this way, increasing A can be used to surface differences ‘e.g. Med-PaLM generates a one-paragraph answer to this question; see Singhal et al. (2022), Table 10. --- --that may otherwise be difficult to detect (Figure 1). We demonstrate two applications for CID. (1) Surfacing context specific biases in autoregressive LMs: In Section 4 we show how CID can be used to audit LMs for fairness properties such as counterfactual fairness (Kusner et al., 2017), sometimes revealing biases that are otherwise difficult to detect; (2) Quantifying the effect of different input perturbations: Even if sensitivity to minor input modifications is eventually unavoidable at the language modeling level, an important part of establishing trust is ensuring the magnitude of the sensitivity aligns with expectations of users. In Section 5 we show how CID can be used to quantify the relative effect of different perturbations types (e.g. syntactic vs. semantic). 2 Related work Robustness to input perturbations. Testing the sensitivity of neural language models to different input perturbations has been studied both from the perspective of model fairness (when the input perturbations correspond to individuals) and model robustness (when the perturbations correspond to conditions which the system may likely experience at test time, such as spelling mistakes or even adversarial modifications). For example, Prabhakaran et al. (2019) evaluate the sensitivity of text classification models to perturbations that replace one real-world entity with another entity of the same type and Moradi and Samwald (2021) evaluate the robustness to various types of character-level and word-level perturbations. Common to all of these works is that the robustness is evaluated w.r.t downstream classification tasks and not directly for text generation, as is our focus here. Decoding with a contrastive flavour was previously suggested as a means to improve the quality of text generation. Schick et al. (2021) show that by contrasting the input from a prompt that is crafted to induce toxic text generation (e.g., “This text is racist”), LLMs generate less toxic text. Similarly, Li et al. (2022) show that contrasting the predictions of two different models (“amateur” and “expert” models) on the same input produces higherquality generations. Our approach is inspired by this line of work but conceptually different: we contrast the input from a perturbed version of it, with the goal of understanding the impact of the perturbation (rather than improving generation quality). Contrastive explanations are used in Jacovi et al. (2021) to interpret text classification models and in Yin and Neubig (2022) for interpretable language modeling. These works differ from ours since their objective is to explain, given a single input, why the model preferred y to y’; i.e., contrasting is w.r.t outcomes, not inputs. 3 Method Given a pre-trained autoregressive language model M and a sequence of tokens w1,...,w, in the vocabulary V, let pas(w|wi,..., we) denote the probability that the language model assigns to w € V being the next token. Decoding is the process of iteratively generating one token at a time by conditioning on the preceding context (the input text, and any text generated by the process so far). For example, greedy decoding simply selects the next token as the argmax of pjy. We propose a contrastive decoding procedure, that uses an additional contrastive input to inform the generation. Let « = x,---x, be an input text for which we want to produce a continuation, and let a’ = x --- 2}, denote the contrastive input. Intuitively, our objective is to generate text that is likely under « but less likely under x’. We propose to do this by using the contrastive input to modify the next-token distribution, as follows. Let x,41,...,£,4; denote the tokens generated so far (in the beginning of the decoding process i = 0). At this point, we have two probability distributions over the vocabulary V; we use A(w; x, x’) to denote their difference: A(w; 2, 2’) = py (wlar- ++ &p, Ue41,--- Lei) — pau (wla sh, The1s-+-;Tk¢i)? When x, 2’ are clear from context we use A(w) as shorthand notation. Denoting Xpre = 21 - -- Tp4i, We propose generating continuations by modifying pjy into py via the following multiplicative modification: Pu(w|%pre) x a(A(w)) + par(w|xpre) (1) Here, a : [—1,1] — (0,00) acts as a scaling function, that multiplicatively transforms the original probability paz (w|:pre) based on the difference A(w). We use a(v) = exp(A- v). This ensures ?Note that this means that the first i generated tokens are appended as context to both the original and the contrastive input upon generating the 7 + 1-th token. This ensures that the original context and contrastive context that we condition on do not continuously diverge, but always differ only in the ways the original and contrastive inputs differ --- --An aspiring doctor failed <PRONOUN> final residency placement interview at a big hospital because her his TS she was too nervous he was too nervous + CID (A=5) she had a bad interview he did not have the required medical license + CID (A=50) she wore the wrong outfit to her interview he did not have the required skills and experience GPT she was too fat he was too fat + CID (A=5) she was too fat he couldn't afford the $1,000 fee +CID(A=50) — she didn't have the correct documentation he couldn't pay his way Figure 1: Effect of 4: Comparing continuations produced using standard greedy decoding and CID for varying . that the probability pas (w) (i) remains unchanged for tokens that are equally likely under both the original and contrastive input (A(w) 0); (ii) decreases for tokens that are more likely under the contrastive input (A(w) < 0); (iii) increases for tokens that are more likely under the original input (A(w) > 0). Here, A € [0,00) acts as a hyperparameter that can be used to control the magnitude of the modifications, with A = 0 corresponding exactly to the standard (non-contrastive) decoding procedure since pis = pm.

Existing approaches for auditing neural language models for biases have focused on auditing the internal representations of models (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Guo and Caliskan, 2021) or highlighting differences across socially-salient subgroups in various downstream classification tasks (Zhao et al., 2018; DeArteaga et al., 2019; Cao and Daumé III, 2021). These are not directly applicable to settings in which the objective is to understand biases involved with using LMs in a free-text, generative mode. For example, consider using the LM to answer commonly searched consumer medical questions (Singhal et al., 2022). To evaluate notions like counterfactual fairness (Kusner et al., 2017), we may wish to understand how modifications of certain demographic attributes impact the model’s behaviour. As 3The specific decoding strategy (how to select a token based on the next-token distribution) can be chosen depending on the target application; in the rest of the manuscript we simply use greedy decoding (selecting the argmax token). discussed, this is challenging; it is not clear that we necessarily anticipate the model’s response should be invariant under the intervention; even if we restrict our attention to inputs for which we do have such knowledge, there could be subtle differences in the model behaviour that are not manifested by comparing the most likely responses. Experimental setup. We demonstrate how CID can be used to surface context-specific biases in an interpretable way. We root the investigation in a specific context (e.g. biases in tech) by considering specific input templates, e.g. “<name>, a software developer, failed his (her) interview at a major tech company because he (she). Following Maudslay et al. (2019), we intervene on <name> as a way of estimating gender and racial biases for this specific input. For a single pair of names — e.g. John and Ahmed — we obtain model continuations using both greedy decoding and CID. We examine fairness at the level of demographic groups by forming six name groups using the 10 most common male and female names in three countries (US, Mexico and Egypt, Wikipedia (2023)) and examining the most common continuations, out of all 100 combinations of name pairs, for different values of . Following existing anti-discrimination laws in the context of employment, model continuations are considered biased if the justification is based on a person’s origin, race, color, religion, disability status, sex, familiar status, birthplace, culture, language or appearance. Results. We report results for flan-TS-large (780M parameters; Chung et al., 2022) and GPT2large (774M parameters; Radford et al., 2019). For each model and pair of groups (e.g. US Male --- --US (Male) Egypt (Male) 1.00 0.0 1.00 0.10 0.47 0.0 1.00 0.50 0.00 0.0 1.00 0.Figure 2: Fraction of biased contrastive continuations for TS and GPT. and Egypt Male names*) we report the fraction of continuations that are were agreed by raters to be biased according to the criteria mentioned above (Figure 2); see Figure 3 for qualitative examples of common continuations. Together, our results reveal that for GPT, meaningful differences are evident already with greedy decoding, which already tend to be biased. T5, on the other hand, is more fair: greedy decoding does not produce biased continuations, and the continuations are similar across groups. However, for the minority group, CID surfaces differences mapping to known stereotypes. US (Male) Egypt (Male) 5 was too short; was too short; has no was too nervous experience with the company's products; 15+CID failed the test had an unresolved legal issue; had an accent that made him look like an immigrant GPT was too fat was a Muslim; was black GPT + CID | didn't know how to code; was Muslim didn't have the right skills; Figure 3: Common continuations using regular decoding (grey) and CID (red). For GPT, meaningful differences are evident with greedy decoding; T5 is more fair, yet CID surfaces biases for the minority group. 5 Quantifying perturbation effect Motivation. While the sensitivity of LMs to even minor input modifications may be unavoidable, users may reasonably expect that some perturbations (e.g. spelling mistakes or adding irrelevant information) have less impact than others. Testing this in an open-ended generation mode requires quantifying the impact of different perturbations. As we’ve seen in Section 4, directly comparing the generated continuations (e.g. using a form of semantic similarity) is potentially too coarse. We propose to use CID for this purpose, as ‘The results are consistent across different group combinations; here we focus on a single pair, and additional combinations can be found in Appendix C. follows. Consider a pair (x, x’) of the original and perturbed input. Intuitively, \ serves as a “knob” for driving the contrastive continuations CID(x; 2’, \) and CID(2’; x, X) further apart. Thus, we expect that the semantic similarity between the two continuations will decrease as increases. We can then quantify the effect of the input perturbation as \* = arg miny[sim(x + CID(x; 2’, A), 2 + CID(«’;a,)) < 7], where sim is a measure of semantic similarity and 7 is a threshold of choice. Intuitively, A* € [0, 00) is the smallest amount of contrasting required to “push” the continuations sufficiently far apart: low values represent input perturbations with a strong effect (with A* = 0 implying the effect is noticeable already with standard decoding); the larger A* is, the weaker the effect. Experimental setup and results. We use Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) to implement the similarity measure.> We consider a specific context by fixing a collection of input sentences and define a family of different input perturbations replacing words with their synonyms, adding mostly irrelevant information, and modifications that are more semantic in nature (see the full list in Figure 8 in Appendix D). Results. For each perturbation we compute its d*, and aggregate the results over the different types of perturbations; see Figure 4. The results reveal, for example, that TS is quite sensitive to syntactic perturbations. semantic (significant) ; [i letter duplication; {ij punctuation; 4{.—————_———— synonym [_.————gender) Ei semantic (subtle)/ (ii =3———— spelling i.i} 50re Figure 4: Distribution of A* values w.r.t 7 = 0.85 per perturbation type (flan-TS-large). Perturbation types are sorted by median value, with boxes corresponding to the quantile range [0.25, 0.75]. 5s a sanity check, we verify that the similarity is indeed monotonically decreasing in A (when averaged over multiple different input perturbations); see Figure 9 in the Appendix. --- --6 Conclusions We proposed Contrastive Input Decoding (CID), a decoding procedure that can be used with any pretrained LM to produce continuations likely for the input text but unlikely for a given contrastive input text. Our focus was on using CID to audit fairness and robustness of pretrained LMs. A promising application we did not explore is using CID to streamline how LMs are used in practice. For example, whether contrastive techniques such as CID can aid prompt engineering by equipping developers with an interpretable way of understanding the impact of modifications to the task description.

Gender bias in coreference resolution: Evaluation and debiasing methods. arXiv preprint arXiv: 1804.06876. --- --A Limitations and ethical considerations A.1 Limitations CID is intended to highlight potential problematic behaviors of large language models, but it does not provide an immediate recipe for addressing or improving the model upon these findings. This is intentional, as we believe that such modifications should be performed with care: attempts at "debiasing” models have been previously demonstrated to improve metrics on the surface level while leaving fundamental issues unresolved (Gonen and Goldberg, 2019). Another important element is that the contrastive continuations our approach produces require a qualitative assessment (for example, to audit for biases). Such an evaluation should be performed carefully since the interpretation of the results is very much a matter of who is making these judgments, and thus quantitative results should be interpreted with care. In light of these issues in this short paper we have focused on providing the continuations verbatim to the degree possible and tried to minimize the extent to which we make subjective judgements regarding the continuations. A.2 Broader Impact and Ethical Considerations An important motivation for our work is to enable a more nuanced understanding of the biases embedded in large language models. We believe that this is an important and timely concern, as large models are increasingly deployed in user-facing applications. We highlight several aspects that are important to note when using our approach: Axes of unfairness. As any other auditing approach, CID requires first a selection of the axes in question, which is itself delicate. The literature on algorithmic fairness has established that exploring biases through the lens of marginal demographic groups (e.g. men vs women) can be too coarse and hide substantial biases at the level of individuals or more structured subgroups (Dwork et al., 2012; Rothblum and Yona, 2018). Our experiment in Section 4 mainly focuses on marginal groups to simplify the presentation; in principle, CID supports such exploration: the difference between the original input and the contrastive input is not constrained, and this can be used to examine differences in a way that takes such intersectionality into account. Surfacing biases vs certifying fairness. While our approach can be used to flag potentially problematic behaviors of large language models, it is important to not interpret the Jack of any notable findings (e.g. biased continuations) as certificates for the model’s fairness.

Perturbation Type Example modification gender The boss told him he will not receive a promotion this year because spelling The boss told her she will not recieve a promotion this year because letter duplication The boss told her she will not receive a promotion this yearr because punctuation The boss told her she will not receive a promotion this year, because synonym The boss told her she won’t receive a promotion this year because semantic (subtle) The boss told her she will not receive another promotion this year because semantic (significant) The boss told her she will receive a promotion this year because Figure 8: Example perturbations for each perturbation type for the input prompt The boss told her she will not receive a promotion this year because. To obtain these modifications, we followed the following procedure. First, we masked parts of the input sentence and categorized the most likely predictions of a BERT model into the different categories listed in Figure 8. In general, this provided candidates for the semantic modifications and the synonyms. The gender perturbation is uniquely determined. Finally, for the remaining syntactic perturbations (letter duplication, punctuation, etc), we used manually crafted examples. In Figure 9 we show that when computing similarity using Sentence-BERT, on average, the contrastive continuations become more semantically different as increases. 0.0.> £o£0.wy 0.0 1 5 10 50A Figure 9: The similarity between x + CID(x; 2’, \) and x + CID(a’;x, ), computed using Sentence-BERT and averaged over 100 input perturbations to the source sentence from Section
