Abstract
Domain adaptation using text-only corpus is challenging in
end-to-end(E2E) speech recognition. Adaptation by synthe-
sizing audio from text through TTS is resource-consuming.
We present a method to learn Unified Speech-Text Represen-
tation in Conformer Transducer(USTR-CT) to enable fast do-
main adaptation using the text-only corpus. Different from the
previous textogram method, an extra text encoder is introduced
in our work to learn text representation and is removed during
inference, so there is no modification for online deployment.
To improve the efficiency of adaptation, single-step and multi-
step adaptations are also explored. The experiments on adapting
LibriSpeech to SPGISpeech show the proposed method reduces
the word error rate(WER) by relatively 44% on the target do-
main, which is better than those of TTS method and textogram
method. Also, it is shown the proposed method can be com-
bined with internal language model estimation(ILME) to further
improve the performance.

1. Introduction
In recent years, E2E models have achieved significant im-
provements in automatic speech recognition(ASR)[1, 2, 3].
Compared with hybrid models, where acoustic, pronuncia-
tion, and language models(LMs) are built and optimized sep-
arately, E2E models have achieved promising performance by
directly mapping speech features into word sequences. There
are some popular E2E models, including connectionist temporal
classification[4, 5], recurrent neural network transducer(RNN-
T)[2, 6, 7], and attention-based encoder-decoder[8, 9, 10].
However, unlike hybrid models which can adapt to new do-
mains by training LMs using text-only data, E2E model has dif-
ficulty in domain adaptation using text-only data. Besides, the
E2E models are trained with paired speech-text data, so their
generalization ability to different contents is limited, and the
performance degrades when a mismatch exists between source
and target domains. To overcome this, the most promising ap-
proach is to adapt the E2E model using text-only data, because
it is much easier to collect text-only data than paired speech-text
data in the target domain.
Several methods have been proposed to adapt the E2E
model to new domain. The most common solution is to train
an external LM using text corpus in the target domain and in-
tegrate it into the E2E model during inference, such as shal-
low fusion [11], density ratio fusion[12], deep fusion[13], cold
fusion[14], and internal LM(ILM) estimation based fusion[15,

16]. Nevertheless, all these methods involve an external LM
during inference, and the computation cost of decoding is in-
creased.
Other methods attempt to directly update the E2E model to
avoid changing the decoding. Synthesizing paired speech-text
data using TTS is a common solution[17, 18], but the process is
complex, also the storage and computation cost increases. Re-
cently, a text-to-mel-spectrogram generator is proposed in E2E
model[19] for replacing TTS. The method proposed in [20] in-
serts a temporary LM layer into the prediction network and the
LM loss is used for adapting with text-only data. Internal LM
adaptation (ILMA)[21] is proposed to fine-tune the parameters
of internal LM with an additional LM loss.
Alternative approaches focus on creating a shared embed-
ding space by joint training for two modalities, i.e., speech and
text, and have been reported to improve ASR performance with-
out increasing model parameters or decoding complexity[22,
23]. Recent works[24, 25] involve this idea to make a consis-
tent representation between text and speech features in text-only
adaptation tasks.
Inspired by [22, 24, 25], we proposed a method to learn
the unified speech-text representation in Conformer Transducer
(USTR-CT) for fast text-only domain adaptation. Separated en-
coders are adopted to learn a shared representation for speech
and text features respectively, and a shared encoder is used for
the fusion of speech and text representation. At the same time,
different representation units are explored and phoneme repre-
sentation performs best in the target domain. To improve the
efficiency of adaptation, single-step and multi-step adaptations
are also explored. Finally, We observe 44% relative WER re-
duction in the target domain with unpaired text data. In ad-
dition, combined with ILME, the proposed method can obtain
further gains.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief
introduction about related work. The proposed USTR-CT is
discussed in Section 3, followed by experiments and discus-
sions in Section 4.
2. Related work
2.1. Speech-text joint training for ASR
Several methods have been proposed to train E2E model with
speech and text modalities[22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].
The recent JOIST[23] explores joint training with a com-
bination of losses computed on the supervised paired speech-
text data and the unpaired text data in cascaded encoder based
streaming ASR framework[32]. The input unpaired text repre-
sentation are up-sampled with a simple and parameter-free du-
ration model, and then fed to a text encoder after masking. The
output of the text encoder can be fed to the first-pass decoder,
or to the shared encoder and second-pass decoder. However,
the experiments were conducted on a multi-domain corpus and
the performance of long-tail rare words are evaluated. In this
work, we mainly focus on domain adaptation, i.e., transferring
the model to the target domain with text-only data.
In order to ensure that the representations learned from
speech and text features are aligned, MAESTRO[22] introduces
a consistency loss to align two types of representations using
the paired data. The method has achieved significant improve-
ments on ASR and speech translation tasks. Different from our
work, it focuses on the self-supervised training to obtain a better
pre-trained model rather than domain adaptation. Besides, the
additional duration model increases the complexity of training.
2.2. Text-only domain adaptation
In this subsection, we give a brief introduction to text-only do-
main adaptation methods without using external LM.
TTS adaptation generates paired speech-text data from the
target domain text for fine-tuning[17, 18]. However, the num-
ber of speakers is limited for TTS and training a reliable multi-
speaker TTS model is time-consuming and computationally ex-
pensive. Besides, saving the synthesized data also increases
storage costs. Moreover, due to the mismatch between syn-
thetic and real audio, additional issues may be also introduced.
To mitigate the above problems, recently a text-to-spectrogram
front-end composed of a text-to-mel-spectrogram generator was
introduced in ASR model[19]. In this way, on-the-fly generat-
ing spectrograms from text-only data is possible, and the mis-
match between real and synthetic audio is not obvious as before.
However, it still needs to pay attention to the quality of the spec-
trogram enhancer in the generator during training.
ILMA propose to adapt the E2E model[21] by fine-tuning
the ILM with text-only data, and parameter regularization is
added to avoid over-fitting. Also, it is essential to perform ILM
training(ILMT)[33] in addition to ASR loss before ILMA to
ensure that the ILM behaves like a standalone LM. As only the
last linear layer of the jointer network is updated, ILMA's per-
formance on the target domain is also limited.
Textogram was proposed in [24], where the text represen-
tation is created by repeating one-hot embedding of text tokens
by a fixed number of times. The textogram features are stacked
together with standard speech features. When training using
text-only data, the speech features are set to zero. And when
training using paired speech-text data, the textogram features
are set to zero. Due to the concatenation of speech features and
textogram, it is necessary to concatenate zero textogram fea-
tures with speech features during inference. However, in our
work, with separated encoders, the input is either text features
or speech features during training, and inference can be per-
formed directly without any modifications. Besides, updating
only the jointer performs best in textogram, while the jointer,
predictor, and even encoder can be adapted to the target domain
with better performance. In addition to grapheme representa-
tion, subword and phoneme representations are also explored in
our work.
3. Training and adapting methods

model. Let be the audio features like Fbank, and yo:u-1

Then with a Softmax layer on the hour and forward-

ability P(yx) of all possible alignment paths π, is computed

where y =
(y1,..., yu) is the label sequence, U is the number

To involve the text-only corpus during training, the RNN-
T encoder is split into two parts, named AudioEncoder and
Shared Encoder, and an extra TextEncoder is introduced
text
to model text features X1N, which is illustrated in Figure 1 as
USTR-RNN-T. The Transducer loss can be computed the same
way as paired speech-text corpus,

where xx can be grapheme/sub-word/phoneme representa-
tions. As the extra TextEncoder can be removed during in-
ference, the proposed method doesn't need any modification for
online deployment.
In our experiments, SharedEncoder consists twelve
non-streaming Conformer[34] layers, so the baseline is noted
as Conformer Transducer(CT). AudioEncoder has two
Conv2d layers with stride of 2 and a linear projection layer,
resulting a time reduction of 4. TextEncoder contains an
embedding layer and a Transformer layer. For CT's prediction
network, 2-layer LSTM is adopted, and RNN-T's jointer net-
work is a feed-forward layer.
3.2. Training
To enforce speech-text modality matching in a joint embed-
ding space for SharedEncoder, paired speech-text samples
are needed for training AudioEncoder and TextEncoder.

When TextEncoder is introduced in the training, the paired
speech-text in the training corpus is used as unspoken text with
a random probability p by using the text features instead of the
audio features.
Three types of text features are considered in this work.
The first one is grapheme features, which is similar as the
textogram in [24]. The second one is subword features,
which is the same as the output vocabulary of CT, and is gen-
erated using subword-nmt[35]¹. The final one is phoneme
features, which is generated by a Grapheme-to-Phoneme sys-
tem. For English in this work, g2pE² is used.
To simulate the duration of speech features, the text fea-
tures are repeated a fixed number of times, which is the same
as that in [24,23]. Also, text features are masked to prevent the
Text Encoder from memorizing the grapheme/subword se-
quence blindly [24, 23]. However, the masking method differs
from that in [24, 23] by applying on repeated text features. It is
found that masking before repeating brings better performance.
During training, a mini-batch containing both text and
speech features is fed into the model. Besides, ILMT loss is
chosen as an optional auxiliary loss, and the overall loss is
where
L=Lrnn-t Lilm
ilmt,
(7)
is the weight corresponding to ILMT loss, which is set
to 0.2 in all experiments.
3.3. Adapting
When the text-only corpus is used for adapting the CT model to
a new domain, two adaptation strategies are investigated in this
work, as illustrated in Figure 2.
3.3.1. Multi-step adaptation
As illustrated in the bottom part of Figure 2, multi-step adapta-
tion using USTR-CT contains two steps.
In the first step, paired speech-text data is used to train a
USTR-CT, where each sample is fed into the TextEncoder
by using text features instead of audio features with a random
probability p to train the TextEncoder. The probability p is
set to 0.15 in the experiments.
In the second step, i.e., the stage of adapting, paired speech-
text data and unspoken text are both used in each mini-batch
with a ratio of 1:1. The ratio can be further tuned to obtain
better performance on the target domain, which is left for future
discussion. The paired speech-text data is used to maintain the
https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt
2https://github.com/Kyubyong/g2p
performance on source domain. In this step, the parameters of
AudioEncoder and Shared Encoder (i.e., the Encoder
of CT) are kept constant, while Jointer and Predictor are
trained to adapt to new domain. Due to the existence of USTR-
CT model after first step, it is more convenient for adapting to
other domains when there is multi-domain scenario.
3.3.2. Single-step adaptation
As shown in the middle part of Figure 2, single-step USTR-CT
trains an adapted CT model from random initialization directly.
Similar to multi-step USTR-CT, paired speech-text data is also
fed into the Text Encoder by a probability p = 0.15. Also,
the ratio between paired speech-text data and unspoken text is
still 1:1 to be consistent with multi-step adaptation.
4. Experiments and results
4.1. Experimental setup
The experiments are conducted on LibriSpeech[36] and
SPGISpeech[37] corpora. SPGISpeech contains 5,000 hours
of financial audio. In this work, only the transcribed text of
SPGISpeech is used for text-only domain adaptation, which has
1.7M utterances. Two versions of the text are created in the
experiments, noted as Large(L) and Small(S), where the for-
mer contains the full 1.7M utterances and the latter contains
a subset of 280k utterances, which is almost the same as the
number of Librispeech utterances. Besides, the TTS audios are
synthesized from the Small subset using an in-house engine to
indicate that TTS is resource-consuming.
For the audio features, the 80-dim filter-bank(Fbank) is
used and Spec-Augment[38] is applied on Fbank features. The
text features are masked with a probability of 0.15 before re-
peating. The model's structure is described as that in Section 3,
and the output of RNN-T is 4,048 subword units. All models
are trained with PyTorch[39]. WER is evaluated on Librispeech
test-clean/test-other sets and SPGISpeech val set to
measure the ASR performance on source and target domain.
4.2. Baseline systems
A CT model is trained on LibriSpeech, which achieves a WER
of 23.55% on SPGISpeech val set. With TTS based adapta-
tion, as shown in the top part of Figure 2, the WER is reduced
to 14.99% by 36.35% relatively. Besides, the textogram[24]
method is also evaluated in this work, which achieves a WER
of 23.94%. Textogram based adaptation, where the encoder
and jointer are kept constant, is trained with text-only cor-
pus. And after adaptation, the WER is reduced by relatively
33.25%/37.80% when using the S/L subset respectively.
The proposed multi-step USTR-CT is firstly trained with
grapheme representation by masking with a rate of 0.15 and
repeating four times. As illustrated in Table 1, the proposed
USTR-CT achieves a WER of 22.72% on SPGISpeech val set
before adaptation, which is better than the textogram. After
adaptation, the proposed method not only performs better on
the target domain, but also achieves the best performance on
LibriSpeech test sets, as the paired speech-text data is used to
maintain the performance of source domain during adaptation.
The results indicate that the extra text encoder in USTR-CT and
jointer adaptation in the second step are beneficial. Also, the
proposed method outperforms TTS based adaptation on both
source and target domains, with relative WER reductions of
2.54% 5.45%.

Different representation units are explored for multi-step
USTR-CT, where the repeating number of phoneme represen-
tation is also investigated. As illustrated in Table 2, for the re-
peating number of 4, phoneme representation performs best on
target domain(WER 13.38% vs. 14.61%/15.00%). This may
due to the phoneme representation is more relevant to Fbank
features, and thus the learning of unified speech-text represen-
tation can be more easier. Besides, we changed the repeating
number from 4 to 3/5 and no further gains were observed.
4.4. Multi-step vs. single-step
We compared single-step USTR-CT with multi-step USTR-CT
and TTS based adaptation, and the results are illustrated in Ta-
ble 3. It is shown that single-step USTR-CT performs best on
both source and target domain. As the shared encoder is also
adapted to target domain, the single-step USTR-CT performs
even better than multi-step USTR-CT. Besides, the extra text of
SPGISpeech also benefits the source domain.
4.5. Combination with ILME
As the text of target domain is already involved in training of
the CT model, the benefit of external LM may be discounted.
We have trained an LSTM LM and evaluated the performance
of ILME using different CT models. As illustrated in Table 4,
ILME brings WER reductions of 41.27%/24.35% on baseline
CT and TTS based models. For multi-/single-step USTR-CT,
ILME also reduces the WER by 24.89%/18.49% respectively.
This indicated that the proposed USTR is able to combine with
ILME to further improve the performance on the target domain.
It is noticed that multi-step USTR-CT performs better than
single-step USTR-CT when combined with ILME, which is dif-
ferent from the results without ILME in Section 4.4. We assume
that the ILM score of single-step USTR-CT is not accurate, as
the encoder also captures the linguistic information of target do-
main during training. Besides, as the encoder is frozen during
the 2nd step, multi-step USTR-CT is more suitable for training
with a large scale text corpus.
5. Conclusions
In this work, an extra text encoder is introduced for text-
only domain adaptation, which outperforms the TTS adapta-
tion by 11.61% relatively when using phoneme representation.
Compared to TTS adaptation, the proposed USTR-CT is effi-
cient and resource-saving for fast domain adaptation. Besides,
USTR-CT is able to adapt to the target domain with a single-
step training and combine with ILME to obtain further gains.
Although experiments were conducted on non-streaming mod-
els in this work, the method is still applicable for streaming
ASR. With the separated speech and text encoders, the simi-
larity between the speech and text modalities can be considered
to further improve the performance, which is left as a discussion
in future work.
