Abstract
Ensuring that large language models (LMS)
are fair, robust and useful requires an un-
derstanding of how different modifications to
their inputs impact the model's behaviour. In
the context of open-text generation tasks, how-
ever, such an evaluation is not trivial. For ex-
ample, when introducing a model with an in-
put text and a perturbed, “contrastive" version
of it, meaningful differences in the next-token
predictions may not be revealed with standard
decoding strategies. With this motivation in
mind, we propose Contrastive Input Decod-
ing (CID): a decoding algorithm to generate
text given two inputs, where the generated text
is likely given one input but unlikely given
the other. In this way, the contrastive gener-
ations can highlight potentially subtle differ-
ences in how the LM output differs for the
two inputs in a simple and interpretable man-
ner. We use CID to highlight context-specific
biases that are hard to detect with standard de-
coding strategies and quantify the effect of dif-
ferent input perturbations.
1 Introduction
Large pre-trained language models (LMS) have rev-
olutionized natural language processing in recent
years (Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020).
However, their practical applicability remains hin-
dered by their extreme sensitivity to minor input
perturbations (natural and adversarial), including
ones that humans deem insignificant (Belinkov and
Bisk, 2017; Sun et al., 2018).
Consider using an LM to answer medical ques-
tions, such as "What happens if listeria is left un-
treated?", as in the HealthSearchQA dataset (Sing-
hal et al., 2022). What is the effect of specifying
demographic information (e.g. “left untreated in
men?" vs "left untreated in women?")? In classi-
fication tasks (e.g. select one option from a list),

we could directly evaluate whether the model's pre-
diction is changed. But in open-text generation
tasks, it is not directly clear how to test the impact
of the perturbation, as the relevant outcome space
is now huge. We could determinsically generate
several likely responses given both inputs (e.g. us-
ing greedy decoding or beam search) and compare
them, but this may only scratch the surface: mean-
ingful differences in model behaviour may not be
revealed with this comparison, which only looks at
a small set of highly probable sequences. Such dif-
ferences, while subtle, are important to understand
and quantify (for example, a malicious user may
attempt to amplify them to trigger a problematic
behaviour even with greedy decoding methods). Al-
ternatively, we could stochastically generate likely
responses given each input (e.g. using temperature
sampling), but then it is less clear how to compare
the outputs we obtained with each input.
Beyond the issues of fairness and robustness, it
was shown that success on many well-defined tasks
is highly sensitive to small changes in phrasing (Sri-
vastava et al., 2022; Efrat et al., 2022), especially
now that "prompt-engineering” became a standard
practice. Given that, understanding the impact of
input/prompt modifications is highly important.
In this work, we take a step towards addressing
these challenges by introducing a new decoding
strategy: Contrastive Input Decoding (CID). Our
decoding algorithm accepts two inputs: a regular
input x and a "contrastive” input x', with the objec-
tive of generating sequences that are likely given
x but unlikely given x'. These contrastive gener-
ations highlight the differences in how the model
treats these two inputs in an interpretable manner.
CID is parameterized by a hyper-parameter λ = R
that controls the degree of contrasting (λ = 0 re-
covers standard, non-contrastive, decoding). In this

way, increasing

that may otherwise be difficult to detect (Figure 1).
We demonstrate two applications for CID.
(1) Surfacing context specific biases in auto-
regressive LMs: In Section 4 we show how CID
can be used to audit LMs for fairness proper-
ties such as counterfactual fairness (Kusner et al.,
2017), sometimes revealing biases that are other-
wise difficult to detect; (2) Quantifying the effect
of different input perturbations: Even if sensi-
tivity to minor input modifications is eventually
unavoidable at the language modeling level, an im-
portant part of establishing trust is ensuring the
magnitude of the sensitivity aligns with expecta-
tions of users. In Section 5 we show how CID can
be used to quantify the relative effect of different
perturbations types (e.g. syntactic vs. semantic).
2 Related work
Robustness to input perturbations. Testing the
sensitivity of neural language models to different
input perturbations has been studied both from the
perspective of model fairness (when the input per-
turbations correspond to individuals) and model
robustness (when the perturbations correspond to
conditions which the system may likely experience
at test time, such as spelling mistakes or even ad-
versarial modifications). For example, Prabhakaran
et al. (2019) evaluate the sensitivity of text classi-
fication models to perturbations that replace one
real-world entity with another entity of the same
type and Moradi and Samwald (2021) evaluate the
robustness to various types of character-level and
word-level perturbations. Common to all of these
works is that the robustness is evaluated w.r.t down-
stream classification tasks and not directly for text
generation, as is our focus here.
Decoding with a contrastive flavour was pre-
viously suggested as a means to improve the qual-
ity of text generation. Schick et al. (2021) show
that by contrasting the input from a prompt that is
crafted to induce toxic text generation (e.g., "This
text is racist"), LLMs generate less toxic text. Sim-
ilarly, Li et al. (2022) show that contrasting the
predictions of two different models ("amateur" and
“expert” models) on the same input produces higher-
quality generations. Our approach is inspired by
this line of work but conceptually different: we con-
trast the input from a perturbed version of it, with
the goal of understanding the impact of the pertur-
bation (rather than improving generation quality).
Contrastive explanations are used in Jacovi
et al. (2021) to interpret text classification mod-
els and in Yin and Neubig (2022) for interpretable
language modeling. These works differ from ours
since their objective is to explain, given a single
input, why the model preferred y to y'; i.e., con-
trasting is w.r.t outcomes, not inputs.
3 Method
Given a pre-trained autoregressive language model
M and a sequence of tokens w₁,..., wk in the
vocabulary V, let PM (w|w1, ..., Wk) denote the
probability that the language model assigns to wЄ
V being the next token. Decoding is the process
of iteratively generating one token at a time by
conditioning on the preceding context (the input
text, and any text generated by the process so far).
For example, greedy decoding simply selects the
next token as the argmax of PM.
...
=
k'
We propose a contrastive decoding procedure,
that uses an additional contrastive input to in-
form the generation. Let x x1 xk be an
input text for which we want to produce a con-
tinuation, and let x' = x¹₁ · · · x', denote the con-
trastive input. Intuitively, our objective is to gen-
erate text that is likely under x but less likely un-
der x'. We propose to do this by using the con-
trastive input to modify the next-token distribu-
tion, as follows. Let xk+1, ..., xk+i denote the
tokens generated so far (in the beginning of the
decoding process i = 0). At this point, we have
two probability distributions over the vocabulary
V; we use (w; x, x') to denote their difference:
A(w; x, x') = Pм(w|x1 k,k+1,• k+i)
PM (w|x¹₁ · · · x k¹‚ Xk+1, • • • ‚·
, 
xk+i). 2 When x, x'
are clear from context we use ✗(w) as shorthand
notation. Denoting Xpre = x1
xk+i, we propose
generating continuations by modifying Pм into pм
via the following multiplicative modification:
Ñм(w|xpre) ∞ a(▲(w)) ·PM(w|xpre) (1)
Here, a : [−1,1] → (0,∞) acts as a scaling
function, that multiplicatively transforms the origi-
nal probability PM (w|x pre) based on the difference
A(w). We use a(v) = exp(\ · v). This ensures
.
2Note that this means that the first i generated tokens are
appended as context to both the original and the contrastive
input upon generating the i + 1-th token. This ensures that
the original context and contrastive context that we condition
on do not continuously diverge, but always differ only in the
ways the original and contrastive inputs differ

4 Understanding context-specific biases
Motivation. Existing approaches for auditing neu-
ral language models for biases have focused on
auditing the internal representations of models
(Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Guo
and Caliskan, 2021) or highlighting differences
across socially-salient subgroups in various down-
stream classification tasks (Zhao et al., 2018; De-
Arteaga et al., 2019; Cao and Daumé III, 2021).
These are not directly applicable to settings in
which the objective is to understand biases involved
with using LMs in a free-text, generative mode. For
example, consider using the LM to answer com-
monly searched consumer medical questions (Sing-
hal et al., 2022). To evaluate notions like counter-
factual fairness (Kusner et al., 2017), we may wish
to understand how modifications of certain demo-
graphic attributes impact the model's behaviour. As

based on the next-token distribution) can be chosen depending
on the target application; in the rest of the manuscript we
simply use greedy decoding (selecting the argmax token).
discussed, this is challenging; it is not clear that we
necessarily anticipate the model's response should
be invariant under the intervention; even if we re-
strict our attention to inputs for which we do have
such knowledge, there could be subtle differences
in the model behaviour that are not manifested by
comparing the most likely responses.

Experimental setup. We demonstrate how CID
can be used to surface context-specific biases in an
interpretable way. We root the investigation in a
specific context (e.g. biases in tech) by considering
specific input templates, e.g. "<name>, a software
developer, failed his (her) interview at a major tech
company because he (she)". Following Maudslay
et al. (2019), we intervene on <name> as a way of
estimating gender and racial biases for this specific
input. For a single pair of names
e.g. John and
Ahmed - we obtain model continuations using both
greedy decoding and CID. We examine fairness at
the level of demographic groups by forming six
name groups using the 10 most common male and
female names in three countries (US, Mexico and
Egypt, Wikipedia (2023)) and examining the most
common continuations, out of all 100 combinations
of name pairs, for different values of X. Following
existing anti-discrimination laws in the context of
employment, model continuations are considered
biased if the justification is based on a person's
origin, race, color, religion, disability status, sex,
familiar status, birthplace, culture, language or ap-
pearance.
Results. We report results for flan-T5-large
(780M parameters; Chung et al., 2022) and GPT2-
large (774M parameters; Radford et al., 2019). For
each model and pair of groups (e.g. US Male

and Egypt Male names) we report the fraction
of continuations that are were agreed by raters to
be biased according to the criteria mentioned above
(Figure 2); see Figure 3 for qualitative examples of
common continuations. Together, our results reveal
that for GPT, meaningful differences are evident
already with greedy decoding, which already tend
to be biased. T5, on the other hand, is more fair:
greedy decoding does not produce biased contin-
uations, and the continuations are similar across
groups. However, for the minority group, CID sur-
faces differences mapping to known stereotypes.

5 Quantifying perturbation effect
Motivation. While the sensitivity of LMs to even
minor input modifications may be unavoidable,
users may reasonably expect that some perturba-
tions (e.g. spelling mistakes or adding irrelevant
information) have less impact than others. Testing
this in an open-ended generation mode requires
quantifying the impact of different perturbations.
As we've seen in Section 4, directly comparing
the generated continuations (e.g. using a form of
semantic similarity) is potentially too coarse.
We propose to use CID for this purpose, as
4The results are consistent across different group combina-
tions; here we focus on a single pair, and additional combina-
tions can be found in Appendix C.
follows. Consider a pair (x, x') of the original
and perturbed input. Intuitively, \ serves as a
"knob" for driving the contrastive continuations
CID (x; x', \) and CID (x'; x, X) further apart. Thus,
we expect that the semantic similarity between the
two continuations will decrease as λ increases. We
can then quantify the effect of the input perturba-
tion as X* = arg minx [sim(x + CID(x; x', \), x +
CID(x'; x, X)) < 7], where sim is a measure of
semantic similarity and 7 is a threshold of choice.
Intuitively, λ* Є [0, ∞) is the smallest amount of
contrasting required to "push" the continuations
sufficiently far apart: low values represent input
perturbations with a strong effect (with X* = 0 im-
plying the effect is noticeable already with standard
decoding); the larger X* is, the weaker the effect.
Experimental setup and results. We use
Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) to
implement the similarity measure.5 We consider
a specific context by fixing a collection of input
sentences and define a family of different input per-
turbations replacing words with their synonyms,
adding mostly irrelevant information, and modifi-
cations that are more semantic in nature (see the
full list in Figure 8 in Appendix D).
Results. For each perturbation we compute its
A*, and aggregate the results over the different
types of perturbations; see Figure 4. The results
reveal, for example, that T5 is quite sensitive to
syntactic perturbations.

monotonically decreasing in \ (when averaged over multiple
different input perturbations); see Figure 9 in the Appendix.
6 Conclusions
We proposed Contrastive Input Decoding (CID), a
decoding procedure that can be used with any pre-
trained LM to produce continuations likely for the
input text but unlikely for a given contrastive input
text. Our focus was on using CID to audit fairness
and robustness of pretrained LMs. A promising ap-
plication we did not explore is using CID to stream-
line how LMs are used in practice. For example,
whether contrastive techniques such as CID can aid
prompt engineering by equipping developers with
an interpretable way of understanding the impact
of modifications to the task description.

A Limitations and ethical considerations
A.1 Limitations
CID is intended to highlight potential problematic behaviors of large language models, but it does not
provide an immediate recipe for addressing or improving the model upon these findings. This is intentional,
as we believe that such modifications should be performed with care: attempts at "debiasing" models have
been previously demonstrated to improve metrics on the surface level while leaving fundamental issues
unresolved (Gonen and Goldberg, 2019).
Another important element is that the contrastive continuations our approach produces require a
qualitative assessment (for example, to audit for biases). Such an evaluation should be performed carefully
since the interpretation of the results is very much a matter of who is making these judgments, and thus
quantitative results should be interpreted with care. In light of these issues in this short paper we have
focused on providing the continuations verbatim to the degree possible and tried to minimize the extent to
which we make subjective judgements regarding the continuations.
A.2 Broader Impact and Ethical Considerations
An important motivation for our work is to enable a more nuanced understanding of the biases embedded
in large language models. We believe that this is an important and timely concern, as large models are
increasingly deployed in user-facing applications. We highlight several aspects that are important to note
when using our approach:
Axes of unfairness. As any other auditing approach, CID requires first a selection of the axes in
question, which is itself delicate. The literature on algorithmic fairness has established that exploring
biases through the lens of marginal demographic groups (e.g. men vs women) can be too coarse and
hide substantial biases at the level of individuals or more structured subgroups (Dwork et al., 2012;
Rothblum and Yona, 2018). Our experiment in Section 4 mainly focuses on marginal groups to simplify
the presentation; in principle, CID supports such exploration: the difference between the original input
and the contrastive input is not constrained, and this can be used to examine differences in a way that
takes such intersectionality into account.
Surfacing biases vs certifying fairness. While our approach can be used to flag potentially problematic
behaviors of large language models, it is important to not interpret the lack of any notable findings (e.g.
biased continuations) as certificates for the model's fairness.

In Figure 8 we give examples of the different perturbation types we consider.
Perturbation Type
gender
spelling
letter duplication
punctuation
synonym
semantic (subtle)
semantic (significant)
Example modification
The boss told him he will not receive a promotion this year because
The boss told her she will not recieve a promotion this year because
The boss told her she will not receive a promotion this yearr because
The boss told her she will not receive a promotion this year, because
The boss told her she won't receive a promotion this year because
The boss told her she will not receive another promotion this year because
The boss told her she will receive a promotion this year because
Figure 8: Example perturbations for each perturbation type for the input prompt The boss told her she will not
receive a promotion this year because.
To obtain these modifications, we followed the following procedure. First, we masked parts of the
input sentence and categorized the most likely predictions of a BERT model into the different categories
listed in Figure 8. In general, this provided candidates for the semantic modifications and the synonyms.
The gender perturbation is uniquely determined. Finally, for the remaining syntactic perturbations (letter
duplication, punctuation, etc), we used manually crafted examples.
In Figure 9 we show that when computing similarity using Sentence-BERT, on average, the contrastive
continuations become more semantically different as > increases.
