ABSTRACT
In this work, we study the impact of Large-scale Language Mod-
els (LLM) on Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) of YouTube
videos, which we use as a source for long-form ASR. We demon-
strate up to 8% relative reduction in Word Error Eate (WER) on
US English (en-us) and code-switched Indian English (en-in) long-
form ASR test sets and a reduction of up to 30% relative on Salient
Term Error Rate (STER) over a strong first-pass baseline that uses a
maximum-entropy based language model. Improved lattice process-
ing that results in a lattice with a proper (non-tree) digraph topology
and carrying context from the 1-best hypothesis of the previous seg-
ment(s) results in significant wins in rescoring with LLMs. We also
find that the gains in performance from the combination of LLMs
trained on vast quantities of available data (such as C4 [1]) and
conventional neural LMs is additive and significantly outperforms
a strong first-pass baseline with a maximum entropy LM.

1. INTRODUCTION
Large-scale language models (LLM), such as as BERT [2], T5 [3],
GPT-3 [4], and PaLM [5], have proven to be successful in natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as, Question Answering, Text
Summarization, and other Zero Shot learning applications. These
models are trained on vast amounts of text data and have yielded
state-of-the-art results across several NLP and search tasks. How-
ever, there is very limited work on the use of these LLMs in Auto-
mated Speech Recognition (ASR).
Recent research has focused on fine-tuning GPT, GPT-2 and
BERT models with small amounts of in-domain data showing that
they tend to outperform the performance of conventional Neural
LMs such as transformer LMs trained on the same data [6]. The
authors in [7] propose the use of pseudo-likelihood scores and show
that rescoring N-best hypotheses from an ASR model can yield sig-
nificant wins on Librispeech but there is always a trade-off between
in-domain modeling and fine-tuning a model trained with far more
text. An alternate approach to directly predict the oracle hypothesis
was originally proposed in [8] and used in [9] to re-rank the N-best
hypothesis using scores from BERT.
In this paper, we scale the use of LLMS to ASR on YouTube
videos, which we use as a source for long-form ASR. We show the

form ASR and compare the performance of LLMs with other neural
and maximum entropy based LMs using two metrics: Word Error
Rate (WER) and Salient Term Error Rate (STER).
2. RELATED WORK
Several methods to incorporate LMs in end-to-end sequence mod-
els have been proposed in the literature. Decoding algorithms
[10, 11, 12] employ fusion strategies, such as shallow [13], cold [14],
deep [15] and component [16] fusion. However, the wins from in-
corporating LMs in this fashion have been relatively small for large
scale ASR [17]. The Hybrid Autoregressive Transducer (HAT)
model introduced in [18] for encoder-decoder models, allowed for
the computation of an internal language model component that can
be quantified and appropriately interpolated with an external lan-
guage model (ELM). The density ratio method proposed in [19]
offers a theoretically grounded solution to leverage an external
language model while separating out the acoustic likelihood score
and the internal LM score on the source domain. This modular
framework lends itself to principled approaches of LM rescoring
and adaptation thus overcoming some of the shortcomings of the
aforementioned LM integration strategies [18, 20].
ASR systems perform best when the training data is matched
to the target domain. However, end-to-end ASR models are trained
on large quantities of available speech data and the LM is trained
on the limited text data available in the target domain, thus enabling
cross-domain transfer. Alternatively, Large LMs are trained on vast
quantities of text and subsequently fine tuned on target domain text.
In both scenarios, finding an optimal combination of the end-to-end
ASR model, with its implicitly trained internal LM and the external
LM, is critical for best performance in the target domain. Neural
Oracle Search leverages HAT factorization for LM rescoring with
an external LM to directly pick the oracle hypothesis [8], while oth-
ers have explored on-device neural and biasing LM integration [21]
and compared rescoring and deliberation [22], demonstrating wins
across all tasks.
In this paper, we study the impact of LLMs within the HAT
framework for long-form ASR. Using data from two different
sources, US English (en-us) and Indian English (en-in) which is
heavily code-switched with Hindi and other Indian languages, we
show that wins of up to 8% relative can be obtained in long-form
ASR while achieving a reduction of up to 30% relative on Salient
Term Error Rate (STER) over a strong first-pass baseline that uses a
maximum-entropy based language model. We also demonstrate the
importance of improved lattice quality that results in a lattice with a
proper (non-tree) digraph topology and carrying context from the 1-
best hypothesis of the previous segment(s) obtain best performance
with LLMs. We find that both Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer
(T5) [3] and its multilingual counterpart, MT5 [23] are complemen-
tary to conventional neural LMs and outperform a strong first-pass
baseline that utilizes a maximum entropy LM.
3. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
Several LLMs have been proposed to date with significant improve-
ments on varied NLP tasks. In this work, we mainly focus on two
LLMS, T5 and PaLM, ranging in size from 3B to 540B parameters,
summarized in Table 1. The conventional neural LM used for com-
parisons is a conformer LM described in Section 4.4 and comprising
of 70M parameters.

3.1. T5 and PaLM
Built on an encoder-decoder transformer-based architecture, T5 op-
timizes the log-likelihood of the target text given input to learn a
mapping from the input to target.
While T5 is pretrained on the span corruption task, LM and Pre-
fix LM are two fine-tuning tasks used for language modeling. The
LM task predicts the target sequence with null context input while
the prefix LM task randomly splits the text into two halves, using the
first half as the input to predict the second half. These fine-tuning
tasks enable direct computation of log-likelihood of the target text,
instead of the estimation of a pseudo log-likelihood as proposed ini-
tially in [2] for masked LMs. Thus, given a text sequence Y, similar
to the LM task, we can compute its T5 score ST5 (Y) by using an
empty string & as input and the text sequence Y as target, with the
following equation:
STS (Y) = log PTS (Y|E; OTS).
(1)
For longer sequences, we can make better use of the previous con-
text and compute the score in a semi-autoregressive fashion. There-
fore, Y can be split into multiple segments Y₁... Ys and the log-
likelihood of the current segment can be computed using the previ-
ous segment's context:
S
STS (Y) = Σ log PTS(Ys|Ys−1;©TS),
where Yo being €.
s=1
PaLM is an autoregressive LM with a decoder-only architec-
ture. Hence the score of a text sequence can be computed straight-
forwardly.
3.2. Integration with ASR Models
In this work, we use a first-pass model based on the conformer ar-
chitecture [24] that uses HAT factorization [18]. Not only does HAT
model provide a posterior score SHAT (Y|X), but it also estimates the
internal LM (ILM) score. As mentioned in Section 2, when interpo-
lating an external LM during rescoring or shallow fusion, estimating
and subtracting the internal LM score yields wins. Thus, inference
search maximizes:
S(Y, X) = SHAT (Y|X) — µSILM (Y) + VSELM (Y), (3)
where and are tunable hyperparameters.

4.1. Data
4. EXPERIMENTS
We conduct experiments with data from two language locales, en-
us and en-in. The multi-domain ASR model used in this paper
is trained on several thousand hours of long-form utterances de-
rived from YouTube videos[25] and short-form utterances that are
anonymized, hand-transcribed and are representative of Google's
Voice Search traffic [26]. The test sets contain long-form utter-
ances derived from 30-minute-long YouTube videos. We set aside
a subset containing 5% of the test utterances as the development test
to tune the hyperparameters.
The pre-training corpus used to train T5 is the publicly avail-
able, Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus(C4), while MT5 is pre-trained
on the multilingual variant, MC4 [23]. To address code-switching
seen in en-in [27], text data consisting of Indian English and Hindi
Wikipedia and CCNet [28] collectively referred to as WEBDOC, is
used. This corpus consists of 170M sentences yielding 2.9B word
tokens. We use 90% data for training and 10% data for validation.
All data in mixed writing systems is transliterated to Latin to be con-
sistent with ASR model training data used for en-in.
4.2. Training Large Language Models
We experimented with T5 and MT5 models of sizes XL and XXL.
Both T5 and MT5 models were pre-trained for 1M steps using the
span corruption task and then fine-tuned for 100K steps using the
prefix LM task on C4/MC4. To address the heavy code-switching
prevalent in en-in and the lack of Hindi data in MC4 corpus, we
fine-tune MT5 on the LM task for an additional 300k steps on the
WEBDOC corpus.
PaLM models with three different sizes were trained as de-
scribed in [5] for the en-us task. The corpus used to train these
models consisted of filtered web pages, books, Wikipedia, news
articles, source code, and social media conversations. We use these
pre-trained models as-is with no additional fine-tuning.
4.3. ASR Models
We use a first-pass ASR model based on the conformer architec-
ture [24] that uses HAT factorization [18]. The encoder consists of
a convolution subsampling layer and 17-layers of conformer blocks.
A conformer block is composed of a feed-forward module, multi-
headed self-attention with relative positional encoding module, a
convolution and a final feed-forward module, stacked together. The
configuration used in this work has an encoder dimension of 512, 8
attention heads, a convolution kernel size of 32 and a decoder dimen-
sion of 640 [24]. The decoder at label yu is only conditioned on the
previous two labels Yu-1 and Yu-2, with their embeddings concate-
nated and projected [29]. The models are trained on 80-dimensional
log-mel filter bank coefficients and predict word-piece targets (4096
for en-us and 8192 for en-in). The choice of these parameters was
determined by sweeping for best performance within the expected
model size.
4.4. Neural and Maximum-Entropy based Language Models
In order to better understand the value of LLMs in ASR, we trained
two state-of-the-art LMs, a conventional neural LM and a Maximum
Entropy based LM. The conventional Neural LM is a small, unidi-
rectional, conformer LM (CLM) with 70M parameters, originally
designed for on-device rescoring [21]. It consists of 12 causal con-
former layers, each with a dimension of 384, a feedforward layer di-
mension of 2048, a convolution kernel of size 15. We use 4-headed
self attention with a left context size 31. The model is trained on the
same data as the LLMs to predict the same word-piece targets as the
first-pass ASR model. Thus, for en-us, we trained it on C4 and for
en-in, we trained it on WEBDOC to match the fine-tuning corpus of
MT5. The Maximum Entropy based (MaxEnt) LM [30, 31] is a log
linear model based on N-gram and skip-gram word contexts, with a
size of 4.5B parameters and is comparable to the size of the T5/MT5
XL models. It is also trained on the same data as the conventional
Neural LM.
4.5. Decoding and Rescoring
Decoding is performed by a time-synchronous beam search using the
breadth-search expansion strategy [32] where the number of active
hypotheses at each frame is bounded by a beam size k. A VAD-based
segmenter [33] runs in parallel to the beam-search decoder. When
the decoder receives an end-of-segment signal from the segmenter,
a segment lattice is generated from the currently active hypotheses.
If present, a rescoring LM is applied to this segment lattice, with
the 1-best hypotheses from previous segments optionally provided
as context. Only the best hypothesis in the lattice (eventually after
rescoring) is carried forward in the beam-search for the next seg-
ment. The final utterance lattice is obtained by concatenating all the
segment lattices.
When using an ASR model with unlimited label context, each
hypothesis within the beam encodes the full history from the begin-
ning of the utterance. Hence, the segment lattice is a trie with a total
number of paths (e.g. hypotheses) bounded by the beam size k.
When using an ASR model where the label context is bound
by n [34], beam-search hypotheses sharing the same label context
of length n will correspond to the same state in the segment lat-
tice. This results in lattice with a proper (non-tree) digraph topology
where the number of paths can grow up to exponentially in the num-
ber of states. This was shown to lead to a significant improvement
in lattice quality: lattice diversity improvement and oracle WER re-
duction [34].
The ASR models described in section 4.3 used limited label con-
text with n = 2. However when combining these models with the
conformer LMs from section 4.4 during the beam search using HAT
fusion results in dramatic increase of the label context limit mak-
ing the resulting combined model to effectively have unlimited label
context.
5.1. Lattice Quality
5. RESULTS
The success of a rescoring approach crucially depends on the quality
of the hypotheses of the first-pass beam-search decoder. To assess
the lattice quality, we computed metrics such as the N-best oracle
WER and the average number of paths/hypotheses per segment for
our baseline systems on the en-us and en-in development sets as re-
ported in Table 2.

Table 2: Lattice quality on the en-us and en-in dev sets.
As the contribution to first-pass model's posterior and internal
LM at label yu depends only on the previous two labels, our baseline
systems can leverage the state merging benefits of limited context
models described in Section 4.5 as demonstrated by the relatively
low oracle WER and high number of paths per segments.
Lattice quality can be improved by improving first-pass model-
ing by integrating a neural LM in the beam-search decoding using
HAT fusion. Table 2 shows this results in a significant improvement
in 1-best WER. However, this causes the loss of the state merging
benefits and results in an increase of oracle WER in en-us. However,
this is still an significant improvement compared to disabling state
merging in the baseline systems.
5.2. Comparison of LMs
In this Section, we consider the impact of LM integration on the en-
us task. Table 3 demonstrates the value of providing longer context
to Large LMs. Each row contains the result of rescoring with the
T5 XXL model when carrying over contexts of different lengths,
i.e., of carrying over the 1-best hypotheses from different number of
previous segments. We observe that carrying over previous context
outperforms no context. However, longer contexts do not seem to
provide additional wins. The rest of this paper thus uses contextual
information from just the previous segment.

Table 4 presents the rescoring and fusion results on the en-us de-
velopment and evaluation test sets for various LMs. First we observe
that a small Neural LM edges out over the performance of a Maxent
LM. Moreover, though the T5 S model, whose size is slightly smaller
than the NLM, was slightly behind NLM, increasing the size of T5
leads to better results. It is also interesting to note that the NLM
and T5 XXL models are complementary, as fusion can give a bet-
ter 1-best WER. In addition, we experimented with more enormous
PALM LMS and they are able to brings the power of larger capacity
and large amounts of training text, yielding better results than T5.
5.3. Code-switching Task
In this Section, we present the performance of LLMs on a more chal-
lenging en-in task dominated by heavy code-switching.
Although MT5 is meant to be a multilingual LM, the amount
of training data from the different languages is unbalanced. The
training data consists of 5.67% English, but only 1.21% is Hindi
in the Devanagari script [23]. This imbalance between en-in and

Hindi fails to capture the frequent code switches between English
and Hindi predominant in the en-in test sets. To address this issue,
we finetune both XL and XXL MT5 models on the WEBDOC cor-
pra with the LM task. We evaluate the raw MT5 model and these
fine-tuned models on the en-in development set to study the effect of
fine-tuning. These results are tabulated in Table 5.

It can be seen that rescoring with the fine tuned models outper-
forms rescoring with the raw MT5 model. This can be attributed to
the lack of sufficient Hindi data in the MC4 corpus which can be
fixed with data balanced fine-tuning. When compared to en-us, the
wins from LLMs on en-in are less. We hypothesize that this could be
related to the small size of the WEBDOC corpus compared to MC4,
in line with the data-hungry nature of LLMs [35, 36].

6. ERROR ANALYSIS
To analyze the effectiveness of large LM, we select unigrams and
bigrams with the highest Term Frequency Inverse Document Fre-
quency (TF-IDF) values from the evaluation test sets (salient terms)
for the two languages studied in this paper. In general, such terms
capture the topic presented in the video. On the one hand, they are
important for indexing or information retrieval; on the other hand,
they are more difficult to be recognized compared to frequently oc-
curring function words (such as, "the", "of", etc.). We analyzed
the performance of the baseline and the various large LMs on these
salient terms to study the impact on rare words. The Salient Term
Error Rate (STER) is reported in Table 7, defined as the number of
deletion and substitution errors on the salient terms divided by the
total number of salient terms. Out of a total of 600K words, approx-
imately, 10% words are tagged as salient terms for en-in and 5% for
en-us. First we observe that almost all rescoring and fusion can re-
duce the error made on these salient terms. In en-us, as reflected by
the WER reported in Table 4, T5 outperforms other LMs. In en-in,
however, NLM fusion in the first pass has a bigger impact on the
salient terms than any rescoring method similar to what has been re-
ported in [37]. Although MT5 has been fine tuned on the same data
as the NLM, we find that it is less impactful by itself on the salient
terms in en-in.
Although MT5 has been fine tuned on the same data as the
neural LM, we find that it is less impactful by itself on the salient
terms. However, in both languages, the combination of these two
LMs through interpolation is additive (last row in Table 6) result-
ing in the best performance. As noted in [35, 36] scaling to larger
and larger datasets is only beneficial when the data is high-quality
and larger models require larger data sets. This can explain some
of the differences seen between these two relatively high resource
languages.

MT5 XL model is the best performing model with a WER reduction
of 7.3% relative on the evaluation test set. On the other hand, the
Conformer LM when used in shallow fusion in the first-pass shows
additional wins. Since we fine-tuned MT5 on the same training data
as Conformer LM, we also report the perplexity of MT5 and Con-
former LM on the 10% validation part of WEBDOC. MT5 has a log
perplexity per word of 4.15, slightly higher than the Conformer LM
at 2.98 and MaxEnt at 3.69.

7. CONCLUSION
In this study, we presented the impact of LLMs (up to 350B pa-
rameters) on long-form ASR. We demonstrated up to 8% relative
reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) on US English (en-us) and
code-switched Indian English (en-in) long-form ASR test sets and a
reduction of up to 30% relative on Salient Term Error Rate (STER)
over a strong first-pass baseline that uses a maximum-entropy based
language model. We also find that the gains in performance from
the combination of LLMs trained on vast quantities of available data
(such as C4 [1]) and conventional neural LMs is additive and sig-
nificantly outperforms a strong first-pass baseline with a maximum
entropy LM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
scales LLMs to long-form ASR.
