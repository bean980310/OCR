--- ABSTRACT ---
An audiobook can dramatically improve a work of literature’s accessibility and improve reader engagement. However, audiobooks can take hundreds of hours of human effort to create, edit, and publish. In this work, we present a system that can automatically generate high-quality audiobooks from online e-books. In particular, we leverage recent advances in neural text-to-speech to create and release thousands of humanquality, open-license audiobooks from the Project Gutenberg ebook collection. Our method can identify the proper subset of e-book content to read for a wide collection of diversely structured books and can operate on hundreds of books in parallel. Our system allows users to customize an audiobook’s speaking speed and style, emotional intonation, and can even match a desired voice using a small amount of sample audio. This work contributed over five thousand open-license audiobooks and an interactive demo that allows users to quickly create their own customized audiobooks.

--- INTRODUCTION ---
Audiobooks have become a popular way to consume literature, news, and other publications. Audiobooks not only allow existing readers to be able to enjoy content on the go, but can help make content accessible to communities such as children, the visually impaired, and new language learners. Traditional methods of audiobook production, such as professional human narration or volunteer-driven projects like LibriVox, are timeconsuming, expensive, and can vary in recording quality. These factors make it difficult to keep up with an ever-increasing rate of book publication. In contrast, automatic audiobook creation is orders of magnitude faster, cheaper, and more consistent but has historically suffered from the robotic nature of text-tospeech systems and the challenge of deciding what text should not be read aloud (e.g. tables of contents, page numbers, figures, and footnotes). We present a system that overcomes both of the aforementioned challenges by generating high-quality audiobooks from heterogeneous collections of online e-books. In particular, our system combines recent advances in neural text-to-speech, emotive reading, scalable computing, and automatic detection of relevant text to create thousands of reasonable-sounding audiobooks. We contribute over five thousand audiobooks totaling approximately thirty-five thousand hours of speech to the open source. We also contribute a demonstration app that allows conference attendees to create a custom audiobook, read aloud in their own voice, from any book from the collection using only a few seconds of example sound. 2.
--- RELATED WORK ---
LibriVox is a well-known project that creates open-license audiobooks using human volunteers. Although it has made significant contributions to the a ibility of audiobooks, the quality of the produced audiobooks can be inconsistent due to the varying skills and recording environments of the volunteers. Furthermore, the scalability of the project is limited by the availability of volunteers and the time it takes to record and edit a single audiobook. Private platforms such as Audible create high-quality audiobooks but do not release their works openly and charge users for their audiobooks. Project Gutenberg hosts a broad collection of free e-books and a few audiobooks. Their existing audiobooks feature a robotic textto-speech voice which limits listen-ability. Text-to-speech is a well-studied problem and recent deep learning
--- CONCLUSION ---
s In this work, we present a novel pipeline to automate the creation of high-quality audiobooks from heterogeneous e-books. Our system uses new advances in neural text-to-speech, emotion recognition, custom voice cloning, and distributed computing to create engaging and lifelike audiobooks. We apply this system to donate over five thousand audiobooks to the opensource community and aim to demonstrate this system by allowing conference attendees to create custom audiobooks. We elieve that this work has the potential to greatly improve the accessibility and availability of audiobooks. 7.
