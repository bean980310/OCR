--- ABSTRACT ---
Since late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become very prominent with LLMs like ChatGPT and Bard receiving millions of users. Hundreds of new LLMs are announced each week, many of which are deposited to Hugging Face, a repository of machine learning models and datasets. To date, nearly 16,000 Text Generation models have been uploaded to the site. Given the huge influx of LLMs, it is of interest to know which LLM backbones, settings, training methods, and families are popular or trending. However, there is no comprehensive index of LLMs available. We take advantage of the relatively systematic nomenclature of Hugging Face LLMs to perform hierarchical clustering and identify communities amongst LLMs using n-grams and term frequency-inverse document frequency. Our methods successfully identify families of LLMs and accurately cluster LLMs into meaningful subgroups. We present a public web application to navigate and explore Constellation, our atlas of 15,821 LLMs. Constellation rapidly generates a variety of visualizations, namely dendrograms, graphs, word clouds, and scatter plots. Constellation is available at the following link: https://constellation.sites.stanford.edu/. The dataset we created will be shared publicly on Github, under @andrewgcodes (https://github.com/andrewgcodes).
--- CONCLUSION ---
The increasing number and diversity of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitate a comprehensive and systematic approach to organize, classify, and understand these models. In this study, we have proposed an effective solution by creating Constellation, a user-friendly web application that visualizes the hierarchical relationships among LLMs, helping to reveal prominent LLM families and underlying structures. Our approach is generally inspired by bioinformatics and sequence similarity. It utilizes hierarchical and agglomerative clustering, combined with an array of techniques such as dendrograms, word clouds, and graph-based representations. The word clouds provide a high-level view of prominent model families, while the graph-based visualization depicts the relationships and similarities among models in a more flexible format than the dendrogram. The major limitation of our study is that it assumes that LLMs are only similar if they have similar names. This is not completely true: LLMs can be named anything by the creator who deposits it to Hugging Face. However, in general, we note that LLMs tend to be named in a structured, logical fashion. Our results indicate that our assumption that in general similar LLMs share similar names is sound. We acknowledge that our approach can miss similar LLMs, especially if one of the LLMs is arbitrarily named. Another limitation is that not all models labeled “Text Generation” are necessarily LLMs. Finally, a further caveat is that the dendrogram is not a true “evolutionary” tree. While models in the same low-level cluster are generally reliably related, this does not hold for higher-level clusters. By making Constellation publicly available, we hope to encourage more systematic and informed engagement with LLMs. As the landscape of LLMs continues to evolve rapidly, tools --- ---such as Constellation will be instrumental in assisting the researcher and developer communities in keeping pace with these developments.
