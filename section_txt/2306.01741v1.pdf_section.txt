--- ABSTRACT ---
This technical paper introduces a chatting robot system that utilizes recent advancements in large-scale language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT (Fig[I). The system is integrated with a co-speech gesture generation system, which selects appropriate gestures based on the conceptual meaning of speech. Our motivation is to explore ways of utilizing the recent progress in LLMs for practical robotic applications, which benefits the development of both chatbots and LLMs. Specifically, it enables the development of highly responsive chatbot systems by leveraging LLMs and adds visual effects to the user interface of LLMs as an additional value. The source code for the system is available on GitHub for our in-house robot| and GitHub for Toyota HSR I.
--- CONCLUSION ---
LLMs like GPT-3/ChatGPT have shown remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, leading to growing interest in applying them to robotic applications. However, connecting a robot with LLMs poses risks such as bias, inappropriate responses, or vulnerability to attacks. Solutions to these problems are in the process of development. To minimize those risks, it is crucial to carefully monitor and control the robot’s output, utilize robust security measures, and provide proper ethical guidelines. --- --G _ GPT-3/ChatGPT | Input (mic/text) Generated text | Speech synthesizer | Gesture Engine | Audio | Text concept Speech and gesture . . ppvewncdntenneneevecneneneeeeeneeeeeeneeeeneeee ; Time-aligned | MSRAbot Toyota HSR gesture generator ; ) Fig. 2. The pipeline of the co-speech gesture generation system. Chat demo [User]: Hi [Robot]: there!Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you? [User]: Nothing. Let's chat. What is your name? [Robot]: My name is Robot. Its nice to meet you! What would you like to chat about? [User]: Let's talk about baseball games. [Robot]: Sure, let's talk about baseball games! What would you like to know? [User]: Who is the popular Japanese bascball player in MLB? [Robot]: The most popular Japanese baseball player in MLB is Shohei Ohtani, who currently plays for the Los Angeles Angels. He is a two-way player, meaning he can both pitch and hit. [User]: What kind of awards did he receive in 2022? [Robot]: Shohei Ohtani received the American League Comeback Player of the Year Award in 2022. He was also selected to his first All-Star Game that year. [User]: Great. Let's change the topic. Who is the famous Japanese football player in Europe? [Robot]: The most famous Japanese football player in Europe is Takefusa Kubo, who currently plays for Real Madrid. He is a winger and has been praised for his technical ability and speed. He previously played for FC Tokyo in Japan before moving to Europe. [User]: Do you know other football players in FC Tokyo? [Robot]: Yes, I do know of other football players in FC Tokyo. Some of the notable players include Shuto Abe, Keigo Higashi, and Yojiro Takahagi. [Send } Fig. 3. Example of the conversation history between a human user and the chat system. In conclusion, this paper introduced an LLM-empowered chatting robot system for achieving a natural and intuitive chatting experience, while also providing synchronized co-speech gestures. We believe that LLMs will facilitate the development of practical robotic applications, provided that we pay close attention to the limitations of those models. ( [2] (3) [4] [5] [6] REFERENCES T.
