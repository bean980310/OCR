--- ABSTRACT ---
A ChatGPT-like system for drug compound analysis could be a game-changer in pharmaceutical research, accelerating drug discovery, enhancing our understanding of structureactivity relationships, guiding lead optimization, aiding drug repurposing, reducing the failure rate, and streamlining clinical trials. In this work, we make an initial attempt towards enabling ChatGPT-like capabilities on drug molecule graphs, by developing a prototype system DrugChat. DrugChat works in a similar way as ChatGPT. Users upload a compound molecule graph and ask various questions about this compound. DrugChat will answer these questions in a multi-turn, interactive manner. The DrugChat system consists of a graph neural network (GNN), a large language model (LLM), and an adaptor. The GNN takes a compound molecule graph as input and learns a representation for this graph. The adaptor transforms the graph representation produced by the GNN into another representation that is acceptable to the LLM. The LLM takes the compound representation transformed by the adaptor and users’ questions about this compound as inputs and generates answers. All these components are trained end-toend. To train DrugChat, we collected instruction tuning datasets which contain 10,drug compounds and 143,517 question-answer pairs. The code and data is available at https: //github.com/UCSD-AI4H/drugchat 1.
--- INTRODUCTION ---
The process of drug discovery and development is a time-intensive and costly endeavor, often taking years and billions of dollars to bring a single drug to market (Avorn, 2015). This process involves the exploration and understanding of vast chemical spaces and the intricate relationships between molecular structures and their biological activities, commonly known as structure-activity relationships (SAR) (Idakwo et al., 2020). Traditional methods (Rycker et al., 2018) often involve laborious iterative testing, with a high rate of late-stage failures. Recent advancements in computational chemistry and chemoinformatics (Zeng et al., 2022) have offered some respite, but there is still a pressing need for tools that can intuitively understand and generate meaningful insights from the complex data inherent in molecular graphs of drug compounds. © Y.

By transforming these molecular graphs into a form amenable to AI analysis, we can enable dynamic exploration of chemical spaces, efficient prediction of compound properties, and intelligent suggestions for drug design and optimization. A ChatGPT-like AI system capable of understanding drug compound molecule graphs and answering various questions about these drugs could revolutionize pharmaceutical research in several ways: e Speeding up Drug Discovery. A ChatGPT-like AI system could drastically cut down the time required for initial stages of drug discovery by providing immediate insights into a compound’s potential therapeutic uses, side effects, and contraindications based on its structure. e Predicting Drug Interactions. A ChatGPT-like AI system could predict potential interactions between new drug candidates and existing drugs. By comparing the molecular structures of thousands of known substances, the system could identify possible conflicts or synergies, helping researchers to better anticipate how a new drug might behave in the real world. e Understanding Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR). SAR (Idakwo et al., 2020) is a crucial aspect of drug design. A ChatGPT-like AI system could help researchers understand the relationship between a drug’s chemical structure and its viological activity. It could also help predict what modifications to the chemical structure might enhance its effectiveness or reduce unwanted side effects. e Guiding Lead Optimization. During the drug discovery process, ‘lead’ compounds those that show promise in initial screenings) (Hughes et al., 2011) are typically optimized for better efficacy, reduced toxicity, and improved pharmacokinetics. A ChatGPT-like AI system could offer suggestions for structural modifications to en1ance these parameters, guiding researchers in the right direction and saving valuable lme. e Supporting Drug Repurposing. A ChatGPT-like AI system could also aid in drug repurposing (Pushpakom et al., 2019) efforts. By understanding the structural properties of existing drugs, it could identify candidates that may be effective against diseases they were not initially developed to treat. This could help breathe new life into existing drugs and offer more rapid routes to treatment for challenging diseases. e Reducing the Failure Rate. The failure rate in drug discovery is high (Hughes et al., 2011), often due to unforeseen toxicity or efficacy issues that emerge late in development. By providing more accurate predictions about a drug’s properties and effects at the outset, a ChatGPT-like AI system could help reduce these costly latestage failures. e Streamlining Clinical Trials.

Developing a ChatGPT-like system for drug molecule graphs is highly challenging. First, one of the primary challenges lies in the representation of molecular graphs. Unlike text data, which is sequential and has a well-defined structure, molecular graphs are inherently non-sequential and highly complex, with no clear start or end point. Developing a methodology to translate these graphs into a format that a GPT model can process is crucial. Second, another significant challenge is capturing and understanding the intricate structure-activity relationships (SAR) in drug compounds. These relationships are often not straightforward and can involve subtle interactions between different parts of a molecule. Third, to train such a system, large datasets of molecular structures, along with their associated biological activities, side effects, and other properties, would be required.

al datasets. Large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in generating inventive text, responding to reading comprehension queries, mathematical reasoning, etc. Nevertheless, the weight parameters of some of the most powerful LLMs are not publicly available, which considerably hinders academic research. Moreover, early LLMs were limited to processing text information as input, restricting their ability to understand information in other modalities. Consequently, researchers have developed an array of publicly accessible LLMs, including multi-modal variants, to address these challenges. LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), an LLM with 65 billion parameters, was developed by Meta AI !. This model is trained on publicly accessible datasets including English CommonCrawl, C4, Github, Wikipedia, Gutenberg Project, ArXiv, and Stack Exchange. This training dataset encompasses 20 languages with the most speakers. Although it is smaller than GPT-3, LLaMA demonstrates superior performance on many benchmarks, including commonsense reasoning, question answering, reading comprehension, code generation, etc. Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LLaMA on around 70,000 user-shared conversations with ChatGPT ?. Vicuna was evaluated using GPT-4. MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023) is a vision-language model capable of processing images and generating textual answers °. For instance, it can create stories and poems from input images and offer solutions to problems depicted in images. MiniGPT-4 incorporates a linear projection layer to align the visual information from a pretrained vision encoder with a large language model. LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023) is another multi-modal model that integrates a vision encoder with an LLM to facilitate general-purpose visual and language understanding *. Different from MiniGPT-4, LLaVA is trained on multi-turn conversation data. The projection layer and the LLM are both updated in the training stage while only the visual encoder parameters are frozen. The training data was created by converting raw image-text pairs into a suitable instruction-following format using ChatGPT/GPT-4. 3. Drug Instruction Tuning Data To train DrugChat, we curate instruction tuning data for drug compounds, from two sources - ChEMBL and PubChem.

After applying further filtering to exclude drugs with insufficient descriptive information, we ended up with a dataset containing 3,drugs. For each drug, we initially gathered its SMILES string, representing the molecular structure. Subsequently, we obtained various molecular features, including the complete molecular formula and its classification as an acid, base, or neutral compound. Additionally, we collected drug-specific properties, such as the mechanism of action and therapeutic applications. Based on these attributes, we manually crafted 129,699 question-answer pairs.

PubChem Drug Instruction Tuning Dataset In this section, we outline the process of constructing the PubChem Drug Instruction Tuning Dataset. The data was collected from the PubChem website’, which houses information of 66,469,244 chemical compounds. We utilized the data version last updated on May 9, 2023°.

It takes a compound molecule graph as input and allows users to ask multi-turn questions about this compound. For each question, DrugChat generates an answer. DrugChat consists of a graph neural network GNN), a large language model (LLM), and an adaptor between GNN and LLM. The GNN earns a representation for the compound molecule graph. The adaptor (which is a linear ransformation matrix) transforms the graph representation into an LLM-compatible soft prompt vector. The LLM takes a user-question and the graph prompt vector as inputs and generates an answer. We employ a pretrained GNN from (Hu et al., 2020) and a pretrained LLM - Vicunal3b (Chiang et al., 2023). When training DrugChat, we fix the weight parameters of the GNN and LLM, and only update the adaptor’s weights. Given a drug in the instruction tuning data and a question about this drug, the drug’s graph is first fed into the GNN to produce a representation vector which is then fed into the adaptor o produce a prompt vector. The prompt vector and the question are fed into the LLM oO generate an answer. A negative log likelihood loss between the generated answer and groundtruth answer is calculated. The adaptor is trained by minimizing this loss.

Language Model menu. Figure 1: An overview of the DrugChat framework. 4.1. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) A GNN (Hu et al., 2020) utilizes the graph structure and node features to learn multiple layers of representation vectors for each node v and a representation vector hg for the entire graph G. The representation of each node is updated by aggregating features from its neighboring nodes. At layer k, the representation h* of node v encompasses information from nodes within the k-hop network neighborhood of v. Formally, h® is calculated as follows: n* = o (hk), AGG ({hE-} uw € N(v)})), (1) where AGG represents a function that aggregates information from neighboring nodes. o is a function that combines information from the node feature of the previous layer and neighboring nodes. N(v) indicates all neighboring nodes for node v. To acquire the representation vector for the entire graph G, a pooling function f (which is permutationinvariant, such as averaging) extracts information from all node features at the final layer K: ha = f({h*,v € G}). (2) 4.2. Large Language Models (LLMs) LLMs utilize the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) decoder to model the conditional probability po(n;|n<;) for token n; in a language model. The Transformer decoder applies a multi-head self-attention block (Vaswani et al., 2017) to the input context tokens and uses a position-wise feedforward network to calculate the probabilities over output tokens. Given the context vector of tokens, the token generation probability is computed as follows: ho = Ni-1We + Wp h, = trans former_block(hj_1)(1 < 1 < m) (3) p(nj|Nj_1) = Softmax(h,W2) where Nj-1 = (1,72, ...,Ni-1) denotes the context vector of tokens, m refers to the num ber of layers, W. denotes the token embedding matrix, and W, represents the positional embedding matrix. --- --DruGCuat: TOWARDS ENABLING CHATGPT-LIKE CAPABILITIES ON DRUG MOLECULE GRAPHS ' 1 ' ‘ 1 1 ' NH ; 1 1 ' i SMILES ' ; S ' ‘ >: ' ; N=C(N)clcce(OCCCOc2cce(C3=NCCN3)cc2)cc1 ; ' ' 1 1 ' [a OC COOoCe coo acooocco See 1 ; Start Chatting : © ' : ' @ aN Restart ' ' : ‘ 1 7, ; Beam search numbers) 1 :——— Temperature—|| what makes this compound unique?

( why it can bind to the catalytic domain of the enzyme? The compound can bind to the catalytic domain of PI3K8 because it has a chemical structure that is complementary to the shape of the catalytic domain, allowing it to fit into the active site of the enzyme and inhibit its activity. This binding inhibits the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3, which is a key step in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that plays a role in cell growth and survival. The inhibition of PI3K5 by this compound has been shown to reduce the proliferation and survival of cancer cells in in vitro and in vivo models, making it a potential treatment for cancer.

Aligned Graph-Text Generation At this stage, we create a prompt for every training graph-text pair, which allows the LLM to generate descriptions from drug compound graphs. We utilize a prompt template that adheres to the conversational format of Vicuna-13b: Q: < Graph >< GraphFeature >< /Graph >< Instruction > A: < Desc > (4) In this prompt, < GraphFeature > is a soft prompt that symbolizes the graph structure feature encoded by the linear projection layer. < Instruction > serves as a directive sentence, prompting the LLM to generate descriptions for the drug, such as “Describe the mechanism of this drug”. During the training stage, < Desc > is populated with descriptive text from human experts to train the linear projection layer. In the testing stage, < Desc > remains empty, and the model is expected to generate descriptive text for the provided drug structure. 5. Results We tested DrugChat on compound graphs that are not contained in the training data. Figure 2 and 3 show two examples.

--- CONCLUSION ---
s, Limitations and Future Work In this report, we present the DrugChat framework, designed to answer questions and generate text descriptions for drugs from their molecular graphs. We develop the ChEMBL Drug Dataset and the PubChem Drug Dataset to train the DrugChat model. With further development and evaluation, DrugChat has the potential to enable conversational analysis of drug compounds. A potential limitation of DrugChat is language hallucination. Since DrugChat incorporates an LLM module, it may occasionally produce untrustworthy answers and descriptions for drugs, which hampers its practical application in real drug discovery pipelines. If DrugChat generates seemingly convincing yet incorrect text descriptions, it could mislead human decision-makers and potentially result in adverse consequences. In the future, this issue could be mitigated by utilizing higher-quality training data and implementing effective filtering strategies. Additionally, more advanced GNN encoders and LLMs will play a crucial role in addressing this challenge. As the number of users increases, human feedback can also be utilized to fine-tune the DrugChat model through reinforcement learning techniques (Ouyang et al., 2022).--- --DRUGCHAT: TOWARDS ENABLING CHATGPT-LIKE CAPABILITIES ON DRUG MOLECULE GRAPHS References Jerry Avorn.
