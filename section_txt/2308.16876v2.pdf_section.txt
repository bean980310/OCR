--- ABSTRACT ---
Human-centric video frame interpolation has great potential for enhancing entertainment experiences and finding commercial applications in the sports analysis industry, e.g., synthesizing slow-motion videos. Although there are multiple benchmark datasets available for video frame interpolation in the community, none of them is dedicated to human-centric scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce SportsSloMo, a benchmark featuring over 130K highresolution (>720p) slow-motion sports video clips, totaling over 1M video frames, sourced from YouTube. We retrain several state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, and we observed a noticeable decrease in their accuracy compared to other datasets. This highlights the difficulty of our benchmark and suggests that it poses significant challenges even for the best-performing methods, as human bodies are highly deformable and occlusions are frequent in sports videos. To tackle these challenges, we propose human-aware loss terms, where we add auxiliary supervision for human segmentation in panoptic settings and keypoints detection. These loss terms are model-agnostic and can be easily plugged into any video frame interpolation approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed human-aware loss terms, leading to consistent performance improvement over existing models.

Despite the availability of various --- --Human Keypoints Segmentation Masks Figure 2: Visualization of human keypoints [78] and panoptic segmentation masks [10]. benchmarks for video frame interpolation, a notable gap exists in datasets specifically tailored for human-centric scenarios. To bridge this gap and to foster the research in this important direction, we introduce SportsSloMo, a new dataset comprising high-resolution (>720p) slow-motion sports videos crawled from YouTube under the Common Creative Licence. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of sports, such as football, basketball, baseball, hockey, etc. Since a video may contain advertisement, transition frames, changes of shot, and non-slow-motion content, we carefully curate the data to remove such unwanted content and finally split each long video into a set of short slow-motion clips of 9 frames. The first and last frames are used as input and the rest 7 intermediate frames are reserved as ground truths for training and evaluating VFI models. In total, our benchmark has 130K video clips and more than 1M video frames. Compared with existing datasets, as shown in Table |, our proposed SportsSloMo benchmark is the largest one so far, with high resolution and focus on human-centric scenarios. While primarily designed for human-centric VFI in this paper, we believe SportsSloMo dataset may also have the potential to aid research in other tasks such as video superresolution [6, 38], group activity recognition [67, 83, 81], and dynamic view synthesis [39, 17, 75]. By releasing this dataset to the entire community, we hope to encourage technical advancement in human-centric video frame interpolation and empower researchers to explore innovative applications in other adjacent fields. Benchmarking existing approaches. To facilitate development and evaluation of human-centric video frame interpolation methods, we re-train several state-of-the-art approaches [27, 36, 23, 25, 29, 28, 82] using their publicly released code on our SportsSloMo dataset. As the human bodies are highly deformable and occlusions are frequent in sports videos, the accuracy of all the methods decrease compared to their performance on other datasets. For instance, EBME [29] and EMA-VFI [82], two of the top-performing approaches on SportsSloMo, produce PSNR scores of 30.and 30.70, respectively - markedly lower than their scores Table 1: Comparisons of different benchmark datasets for video frame interpolation.

Benchmark datasets Existing publicly available datasets already provide a valuable resource for developing and evaluating video frame interpolation methods. We would briefly introduce these datasets and reveal some limitations in this section. Table. 1 shows a comparison between existing datasets and our proposed SportsSloMo dataset. The SNU-FILM [| 4] dataset is a widely-used benchmark for VFI evaluation, containing 1240 frame triplets ofx 720 resolution. And it is divided into four different parts, namely, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extreme according to motion magnitude. The Middlebury benchmark [1] is another widely used dataset, image resolution in this dataset is around 640 x 480. However, it is commonly only used to evaluate VFI methods for 8 sequences. UCF101 [65] is originally a dataset for human action recognition, containing a variety of human actions. With the test set constructed by [43], it is also used to evaluate VFI methods, containing 379 triplets of 256 x 256 frame size. Nevertheless, its scale is rather small and its resolution is also low. The Adobe240fps dataset [66], originally for video deblurring, is another widely used dataset for VFI. It is consisted of high frame-rate videos (240 fps) with a resolution ofx 720, yet the videos are from only 118 clips. The mostly used dataset for training and evaluating VFI methods is the Vimeo90K dataset [79]. It containsframe triplets from 14777 video clips extracted from reallife video clips with a fps < 30. Nevertheless, one of its main drawback is the low resolution of 448 x 256 obtained by downscaling the original high resolution frames. Moreover, as VFI methods have been rapidly improving in recent years, their performance on the widely-used Vimeo90K dataset has approached saturation. To further advance the state-of-the-art in video frame interpolation, a new dataset with bigger scale, higher resolution and more challenging scenarios is necessary. X4K1000FPS is a recently released high frame rate (1000 fps) with 4K spatial resolution to promote the study of VFI for very high resolution videos. As a result, none of existing datasets contains rich human-centric data with high resolution and big scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce the SportsSloMo dataset, a human-centric VFI dataset with 130K video clips and 1M video frames at 240 fps with a resolution of 1280 x 720, aiming to foster research in human-centric VFI. 2.2. Video frame interpolation methods Existing VFI methods could be generally classified into flow-agnostic and flow-based methods. Flow-agnostic approaches model VFI without explicit intermediate motion representation. Phase-based methods [48, 47] directly predict the phase decomposition of the intermediate frame, but can only handle motion within a limited range. Kernel-based methods are the mainstream approach in this category, which typically aims to estimate intermediate frames by learning adaptive kernels to convolve input frames [53, 54]. Over the years, numerous improvements are proposed in this field, including using deformable convolution [11, 12], formulating interpolated motion estimation as classification [56], blending deep features [19], introducing dual-frame adversarial loss [36], performing channel attention [14] and utilizing 3D space-time convolutions [32]. Recently, Shi et al. [63] introduced a Transformer-based framework to model long-range dependencies with the aid of attention mechanisms. By directly hallucinating pixel values, these methods tend to generate blurry results and artifacts, especially in fast-moving scenes [44]. Flow-based approaches currently serve as a promising direction in VFI. Generally speaking, flow-based method takes a paradigm of a two-stages pipeline: (1) flow estimation, and (2) frame synthesis. They first estimate optical flow between input frames, and then synthesize intermediate frames using image warping [26]. As a representative work, SuperSlomo [27] by Jiang et al. adopted a skip-connected U-Net to estimate bi-directional optical flows under the assumption of linear motion. Quadratic [77] and cubic [13, 69] trajectory assumptions have also been made to approximate intermediate motion. Recent work has explored various techniques to improve intermediate flow estimation and interpolation accuracy, including forwardwarping via softmax splatting [52, 23], voxel flow [43], cycle consistency loss[61, 41], task-oriented flow distillation loss [35], Gram matrix loss [60], implicit neural function [9], occlusion mask [3], anchor points alignment [64], privileged distillation [25], and pyramid recurrent flow estimation [28]. Considering additional information like contextual maps [51], depth maps [2] and auxiliary visual information from event cameras [70, 21, 8] can also further improve interpolation accuracy. Park et al. employed symmetric bilateral motion field estimation, and further improved intermediate motion estimation accuracy through asymmetric bilateral motion field [55]. Lu et al. [44] leveraged Transformer architecture [71] to model long-term dependency. Jin et al. [29] proposed a novel bi-directional motion estimator in a pyramid structure. Zhang et al. [82] proposed a novel feature extraction strategy to combine motion and --- --0.0.16 mmm SportsSloMo oe mm SNUriM me Xapo 50.Zo.0a © 0.0.boo ii Min sete 0.oO 20 80 100flow Magnitude one te —o ons = SNUFLM mmm X4K1000FPS.50.go“0.0.002) Mltlinsssssnsseye 20s. ne a RT Fw Niagitude (c) Figure 3: The SportsSloMo dataset.

In a nutshell, although previous methods have proposed successful designs to handle complex motion and occlusion, none of them is carefully designed for human-centric scenes. As discussed in Sec. 1, human-centric VFI is confronted with various challenges including dynamic pose variation, complex human motion patterns and occlusion in crowded scenes. Additionally, accurately synthesizing fine details such as facial expressions and hand gestures can be challenging. To this end, we propose to consider humanaware loss terms through incorporating extra supervision to both human keypoints detection and segmentation in the panoptic setting. 3. SportsSloMo Benchmark A myriad of benchmark datasets for video frame interpolation are available, including Middlebury [1], GoPro [50], UCFI101 [65], DAVIS [57], Adobe240fps [66], Vimeo90K [79], SNU-FILM [14] and X4K1000FPS [64]. But none of these them focuses on human-centric VFI, e.g., in sports scenes. This limits the study of VFI methods targeted for human-centric applications such as enhanced entertainment experiences, commercial deployment, etc. To bridge this gap and to foster future research, we propose SportsSloMo, a challenging dataset consisting of high-resolution (> 720p) sports videos crawled from YouTube under the Common Creative License. Careful curation has been taken to remove the unwanted content in the videos, including advertisement, transition frames, changes of shot, flashing lights, and non-slow-motion content. Specifically, we first conduct human detection on all the videos by utilizing Yolov3 [62] and remove video frames without detected humans. Second, we remove frames with flashing lights by setting a threshold about the brightness change between consecutive frames (large brightness change indicates the existence of a flashing light). Third, we use RAFT [68] to measure motion magnitude and set a threshold to discard non-slow-motion video segments. Finally, we carefully curate the the extracted clips manually to keep only high-quality self-consistent videos. With such semi-automatic curation, we end up having a set of short slow-motion clips of 9 frames, where each frame has a spatial resolution of at least 1280 x 720. The first and last frames are used as input for a VFI method and the 7 intermediate frames as ground truths for model training and evaluation, approximately corresponding to converting a video of 30-fps (frames per second) to 240-fps. In total, we collect 131,464 video clips and 1.2M individual video frames from 259 raw YouTube videos, which covers 22 various sports categories in our dataset with different content and motion patterns, including hockey, base --- --Panoptic Segmentation] Plug-in Human-aware Loss Module Keypoint Detection Panoptic | segmentation] Keypoint Leasie Figure 5: Illustration of our proposed human-aware loss terms, consisting of losses about human segmentation in the panoptic setting and keypoint detection. ball, skating, basketball, running, volleyball, etc. Fig.shows the proportion of different sports categories. Visualizations of randomly sampled video frames are available in Fig. 3. We refer the readers to the supplementary material for more results. As shown in Table 1, compared with existing datasets, not only our dataset is tailored for human-centric scenarios, but also surpasses others in terms of scale, resolution, and frame rate. Fig. 3 demonstrates the histogram of flow magnitude of all pixels and mean flow magnitude of all images in our dataset (calculated using GMFlow [76]), with a comparison with the widely-used SNU-FILM [14] dataset (which has the same spatial resolution as ours) and the recently introduced X4k1000FPS [64] dataset. As can be seen, our SportsSloMo benchmark contains more largedisplacement motion compared to the SNU-FILM dataset. For instance, for the avarege flow magnitude on the imagelevel (Fig. 3(c)), our dataset has way more images, whose mean flow magnitude is greater than 20 pixels. And we can also observe that both our SportsSloMo and X4K1000FPS datasets contain large motions. We split our proposed SportsSloMo dataset into train and test, containing 115,421 and 16,043 video clips, respectively. For each sports category, videos are split into train and test without intersection, so that the test videos are completely unseen during training. 4. Human-aware Video Frame Interpolation 4.1. Overview Given two input frames Jp and J;, the goal of VFI is to synthesize the intermediate frame J, at an intermediate time step t € (0,1). A VFI method needs to find the pixel-wise correspondences between J, and J, and adaptively fuse corresponding pixels to synthesize each pixel in [;. Flow-based approaches, such as SuperSloMo [27] and EBME [29], usually explicitly model the correspondences as optical flow, whereas flow-agnostic methods, such as AdaCof [36], use learned kernels to process the visual correspondence implicitly. To supervise the network training, the reconstruction error of the intermediate frame is used as the loss. For instance, in [29], the weighted sum of the Charbonnier loss [7] Lchar and census loss [46] Leen between the ground truth intermediate frame [; and synthesized frame I, are adopted Loasic = Lenar(Li — ft) + cen « Leen, ft), where Lenar(2) = (x? + €?)*%,a = 0.5,€ = 107%. Such reconstruction loss, however, may not provide enough supervision for human-centric VFI due to the challenges of highly deformable human motion and frequent occlusion. To address these challenges, we propose to incorporate Dseg and L,,, into the network supervision based on human segmentation in the panoptic setting and keypoint detection, respectively, enforcing the model to produce high-quality synthesis results over human boundaries and along the keypoint trajectories. The final loss is L = Lpasic + AsegLseg + AkptLkpe- (2) It is worth noting that our proposed human-aware loss terms are flexible, which can be plugged into other flow-based (e.g., SuperSloMo [27] and EBME [29]) or flow-agnostic VFI models (e.g., AdaCoF [36]), as shown in Section 5. --- --4.2. Human Segmentation Loss In human-cenrtic scenarios, accurate estimation of human body boundaries is crucial. In regions where the body movement is complex or there are heavy occlusions, inaccuracies in the estimated body boundaries may lead to visible artifacts in the synthesized video frame. To this end, we propose to incorporate human segmentation as extra supervision to improve the synthesis of intermediate video frames. Human segmentation masks directly tell where human body boundaries are, as shown in Fig. 2, helping to reduce ghost effects. Though instance and panoptic segmentation could both serve for this purpose, we empirically find that the panoptic segmentation models tend to yield better interpolation results than instance segmentation counterparts. Specifically, we adopt state-of-the-art Mask2Former [10] trained on COCO panoptic dataset [33] with the SwinL backbone [42] from Detectron2 [74] to generate panoptic segmentation masks M, from the ground-truth intermediate frame J;. During training, the panoptic segmentation results M of the synthesized intermediate frame f, 1 obtained using the same Mask2Former model is compared with M;. Ideally, if the synthesized intermediate frame I, is identical to the ground truth [;, M, should be the same as M;. By comparing their difference, the human segmentation loss enhances the consistency of the human body boundaries between J; and I, 1, Which helps reduce the ghost effects. We follow the loss function of Mask2Former and use the binary cross-entropy loss L,,. and the dice loss Lajce [49] for the human segmentation loss Lseg = AceLce(Me, Mr) + AdiceLaice(Mi, Mr), 3) where we set Ace = 5.0 and Agice = 5.0. The panoptic segmentation model is frozen during training and the gradient of this loss will be backpropagated to a VFI model only ina way similar to the perceptual loss [31], enforcing the model to produce high-quality synthesis results. 4.3. Human Keypoint Detection Loss In addition to segmentation, we also consider the human keypoints estimation as an extra supervision. Accurate estimation of human keypoints is also crucial for humancentric VFI, which are indicative about the position of each body part, providing additional cues for motion estimation. Hence, by incorporating the supervision of human keypoints, we can better preserve human motions by enforcing coherent motion trajectories and guide the interpolation process to generate more plausible intermediate frames. Specifically, we adopt the state-of-the-art human pose estimation model ViTPose [78] trained on COCO [40], with the ViT-L backbone [15] initialized with MAE [20] pretrained weights. We first use an off-the-shelf human detector YOLOv8 [30] to detect person instances in the groundtruth intermediate frame J;. We then employ ViTPose to Ground Truth EBME EBME w/ HL Figure 6: VFI results with human-aware loss (HL) terms. We can see better human segmentation, keypoint detection, and interpolation result can be obtained enhanced by the human-aware loss. estimate the keypoints heatmap /x; containing the locations of each joint. Similar to the human segmentaiton loss, we estimate the keypoints heatmap K, using the same ViTPose model on the synthesized intermediate frame I. The differences between Ky; and K , are then used as the supervision to improve VFI results. We follow the loss function of ViTPose and use the MSE (mean square error) loss over heatmaps as the human keypoint loss Ly. Lipt = MSE(Ki, Ki). (4) The ViTPose model is frozen during training and the gradient of this loss will be backpropagated to a VFI model to encourage high-quality intermediate frame synthesis so that the estimated human keypoints are close to the ones obtained from the true intermediate frame. 5. Experiments 5.1. Setup VFI models. We benchmark existing VFI approaches by re-training several state-of-the-art methods on our SportsSloMo dataset using their publicly available code, including SuperSlomo [27], AdaCoF [36], M2MVFI [23], RIFE [25], EBME [29], UPR-Net [28], and EMA-VFI [82]. AdaCoF is a flow-agnostic VFI model and the rest are flow-based.

With the enhancement of the human-aware (HL) losses, EBME achieves better interpolation results. Table 2: Quantitative results of different approaches on the SportsSloMo dataset.

We also incorporate our proposed human-aware loss terms into these models to validate the effectiveness of explicitly taking human priors into account to improve humancentric VFI. Evaluation metrics. Following previous VFI methods [27, 24], we adopt the widely-used signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) [72], and interpolation error (IE) [1] to evaluate the interpolation results. For PSNR and SSIM, higher indicates better performance. And for IE, the lower the better. Implementation details. For the human segmentation and keypoint loss terms, to avoid the influence of Batch Normalization (BN) layers on the training phase, we replaced the BN layers with frozen Batch Normalization (frozen BN) layers. We use the default hyperparameters provided by each VFI model. Training and evaluation are both conducted on 8 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs. During training, we randomly sample a frame between the first and the ninth (last) frame for VFI methods supporting arbitrary time frame interpolation like SuperSlomo [27], M2MVFI [23], RIFE [25], EBME [29], UPR-Net [28], and EMA-VFI [82]. For VFI methods that can only synthesize the middle frame like AdaCoF [36], we randomly generate triplets within the nine frames such that the target frame is always in the middle of the input two frames. During evaluation, arbitrary-time-supported VFI methods take the time step as input and interpolate every intermediate frame, while single-frame methods recursively generate each intermediate frame. 5.2. Benchmarking Existing Methods Table 2 shows quantitative comparisons between existing VFI methods on our proposed SportsSloMo dataset. We can see that EMA-VFI [82] performs the best interms of all three evaluation metrics. It is worth noting that the performance for each model decreases compared with results on popular datasets. For instance, two top-performing approaches on SportsSloMo, EBME [29] and EMA-VFI [82] produce PSNR scores of 30.15 and 30.70, respectively, compared with 36.19 and 36.64 on the Viemo90K [79] as well as 30.64 and 30.94 on the hard split of the SNUFILM [14] benchmarks.

We provide more details in the supplementary material. 5.3. Enhanced Human-aware VFI Table 2 also demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed human-aware losses. Specifically, we incorporate the proposed human segmentation and keypoint losses into each of the VFI models. As can be seen, they consistently improve the performance of every single VFI method for all three evaluation metrics. Specifically, in terms of PSNR, our proposed human-aware losses lead to improvement of 1.6% and 1.1% for SuperSloMo [27] and EBME [29], respectively. In terms of IE, the improvement for these two methods are 7.4% and 5.6%, respectively. Qualitatively, we can see from Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, our proposed human-aware loss terms can improve interpolation results for the highly deformable arms of the athletes and the background under occlusions. 5.4. Ablation Study In this section, we present ablation study on SuperSloMo [27] and EBME [29] to analyze the design choices of our proposed human-aware losses in Table 3. As can be seen, both human segmentation and keypoint detection losses can successfully improve the performance of SuperSloMo and EBME. This justifies our motivation to leverage human-aware priors to improve the human-centric VFI. By combining these two losses, the largest performance gain can be obtained for both methods. Furthermore, from Fig. 6, we can clearly see that better interpolation results can be obtained around the elbow and hand. 5.5. Limitations and Discussions While we have introduced human-aware loss terms to handle challenging human-centric scenarios in our proposed dataset, there still remains noteworthy limitations for future exploration. First of all, for human-centric scenes, the presence of large, complex, and highly deformable human motions and occlusion by crowds make finding correspondences of humans (i.¢., optical flow) between input frames a challenging task. Recent studies [25, 35] have demonstrated the effectiveness of knowledge distillation [22] to improve the intermediate optical flow estimation. We also explored this loss to incorporate extra supervision for flow-based VFI methods (e.g., SuperSloMo [27], EBME [29]). Specifically, we use the optical flow results obtained from state-of-the-art model GMFlow [76], which is pre-trained on the optical flow benchmarks [16, 45, 5], as the teacher network to perform flow distillation. We found, however, mixed results on our SportsSloMo benchmark. While it indeed improves the performance for SuperSlomo [27] (PSNR: 29.77 vs. 30.18), it hurts the performance for EBME [29] (PSNR: 30.15 vs. 29.85). We also fine-tune the GMFlow model on the human flow dataset [59], consisting of synthetic human figures overlaied on top of real world images as background. However, we observed significant domain gap between the synthetic training images and real-world test images, which lead to poor optical flow estimation results. How to improve human-centric optical flow to improve VFI is still a challenging problem. Second, we only utilize 2D cues of human bodies in our proposed loss terms to enhance VFI. Recently, there has been significant advance made in 3D human body reconstruction from videos, for instance, [18, 80, 58, 34], considering both the spatial and temporal information. By lifting 2D videos into the 3D space, occlusions may be better solved. More advanced loss terms involving 3D human reconstruction is worth exploring. We leave this as future work to explore. Finally, in the SportsSloMo dataset, various sports involve fast-moving balls and sports equipment. In this paper, we only consider human boundary and body parts for motion estimation. Fast-moving objects, however, in these scenarios are also challenging for VFI. More effort is needed for such a problem. 6.
--- CONCLUSION ---
In this paper, we introduced a new benchmark, SportsSloMo, focusing on human-centric video frame interpolation. Our benchmark contains 130K video clips and more than 1M video frames obtained from high-resolution (> 720p) slow-motion sports videos crawled from YouTube with careful curation. Due to the complex, highly deformation human motion and frequent occlusion, this benchmark imposes significant challenges to existing VFI models. To enhance their accuracy, we introduce human-aware loss terms to improve existing methods, where the supervision of human segmentation and keypoints detection are --- --incorporated. Our loss terms are model agnostic and have been successfully applied to seven existing VFI methods, leading to better accuracy consistently. Our benchmark dataset and code will be publicly released to foster future research in the new exciting direction of human-centric VFI.
